## A Taste of the South Pacific on the Stardust Strip

The 1960s Las Vegas Strip was known for its extravagant spectacle – glittering showrooms, glamorous showgirls, and increasingly elaborate resort themes. But beyond the gaming tables and headliner acts, themed dining experiences became a crucial element of the overall entertainment package. And few were as immersive and memorable as Aku Aku, a Polynesian restaurant that opened within the Stardust Resort & Casino on January 29, 1960. It was a bold departure from the typical Vegas fare and offered a portal to a tropical fantasy unlike anything seen before.

## Entering a Polynesian Dreamscape

Imagine stepping off the bustling casino floor and being instantly transported to a South Pacific atoll. That’s precisely what Aku Aku delivered.  The entrance itself was a theatrical marvel – imposing Moai-style statues, expertly carved by the renowned Eli Hedley, guarded the entrance, visually severing the connection to the casino and promising an escape. Inside, the attention to detail was astonishing. Thatched roofing, carefully constructed faux lava rock formations, lush tropical foliage, and intricate bamboo detailing created a truly convincing atmosphere. A winding bridge added to the sense of discovery, reinforcing the feeling that you had truly left Las Vegas behind. It was more than just a restaurant; it was a carefully curated experience. 

## Exotic Flavors & A Brief Setback

The menu at Aku Aku leaned into the exotic, reflecting the era’s fascination with Polynesian and broader Asian cultures. Think tropical cocktails with elaborate garnishes, fresh seafood, succulent ribs, and unique egg rolls. Dishes boasted fanciful names – one menu even listed a “Lotus Blossom Dinner” featuring ingredients like “dwarf Japanese shrimp cocktail” and “breast of young Cantonese duckling.”  The food was designed to appeal to a Las Vegas audience eager for something new and exciting. Sadly, the initial momentum was briefly stalled when a fire in the attic area caused smoke damage, forcing a temporary closure.  But the restaurant quickly rebounded, proving its popularity with guests.

## A Beloved Stardust Fixture and Its Legacy

For nearly two decades, Aku Aku thrived as a beloved fixture within the Stardust. It wasn't just a place to eat; it was a social hub, a meeting place for those seeking a memorable Vegas experience.  As the 1970s rolled into the 80s, however, the peak of the Tiki and Polynesian dining craze began to wane. Aku Aku closed its doors in 1980, ending its 20-year run. 

While the physical space and elaborate décor are now lost, the memory of Aku Aku lives on. Vintage menus are treasured collectibles, and one of Eli Hedley’s iconic Moai statues found a new home at Sunset Park in Las Vegas, a lasting monument to the restaurant's unique charm.  Aku Aku stands as a wonderful example of how mid-century Las Vegas resorts understood the power of immersive experiences, extending entertainment beyond gambling and shows into richly themed dining. It's a vital piece of Las Vegas' layered history, inspiring nostalgia and showcasing the creativity that shaped the iconic Las Vegas Strip.
