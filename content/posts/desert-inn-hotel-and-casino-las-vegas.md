## The Dawn of a New Era on the Strip

Before the mega-resorts and dazzling spectacle of modern Las Vegas, there was a more intimate, elegant charm. The Desert Inn Hotel and Casino, opening its doors on April 24, 1950, embodied that era. As the Strip’s fifth resort, nestled between what would later become iconic landmarks, the Desert Inn was more than just a hotel and casino; it was a pivotal moment in Las Vegas history. It signaled a shift from small-town gambling halls to a vision of sophisticated entertainment and luxury.

Initially boasting 300 rooms and a spacious 2,400 square foot casino (considerably large for the time), the Desert Inn stood as a symbol of ambition. Its grand fountain, a first for Strip resorts, welcomed guests and set a tone of refined hospitality. The Sky Room restaurant offered exquisite dining with panoramic views, and the golf course, designed by George Fazio, quickly became a draw for golf enthusiasts. 

## Sinatra's Debut and Tournament of Champions

The Desert Inn's star power skyrocketed when Frank Sinatra made his Las Vegas debut there in 1951. His performances cemented the resort's reputation as a premier entertainment destination and turned him into a Las Vegas regular. The property also played a significant role in the world of professional golf, hosting the prestigious PGA Tour Tournament of Champions from 1953 to 1966, attracting some of the biggest names in the sport.

## Evolution and Demise

Over the decades, the Desert Inn expanded with the addition of the St. Andrews Tower (1963), the Augusta Tower (1978), and later, the Palms Tower (1997), reflecting evolving architectural styles. A $200 million renovation in 1997 aimed to modernize the property and keep it competitive. However, the winds of change were inevitable. 

In 2000, Steve Wynn acquired the Desert Inn for a staggering $270 million, signaling an end to an era.  The resort closed its doors on August 28, 2000, leaving behind a legacy of elegance and innovation. Most of the buildings were demolished shortly after, paving the way for Wynn’s ambitious new resorts. Only two towers remained until their eventual implosion in 2004. 

## A Lasting Legacy

While the physical Desert Inn is now largely a memory, its impact on Las Vegas remains undeniable. The legendary golf course lives on, integrated into the Wynn resort, a constant reminder of the Desert Inn's contribution to the city’s landscape and its rich history. The Desert Inn helped define the luxury and entertainment that would come to characterize the Las Vegas Strip, leaving an indelible mark on the city’s evolution.
