## A Quirky Beginning: The Tallyho Years

Before shimmering minarets and flying carpets, the site of the Aladdin Hotel & Casino held a surprising secret: it was once a very English affair. In 1962, toy tycoon Edwin S. Lowe, famous for his novelty toys, opened the Tallyho Hotel. Imagine – a Tudor-style hotel, complete with faux half-timbering, plopped down on the burgeoning Las Vegas Strip! What made Tallyho truly unique, and ultimately its downfall, was its lack of a casino. Lowe's experiment in providing a hotel experience *without* gambling proved unsustainable within a year, highlighting the undeniable allure of gaming in Nevada. This unusual chapter underscores the evolving nature of the Las Vegas Strip, constantly reinventing itself. 

## From King’s Crown to Arabian Dreams

The property quickly changed hands, becoming the King’s Crown Tallyho in 1963. Plans for a casino lingered, but financing troubles – a common theme in Vegas history – prevented their realization. Thankfully, the property landed in the capable hands of entertainment mogul Milton Prell in 1966. Prell, a true visionary, recognized the potential for spectacle. He completely transformed the Tudor aesthetic, embracing an opulent Arabian Nights theme. Thus, on April 1, 1966, the Aladdin Hotel & Casino was born. 

## A Golden Age of Glamour and Entertainment

The Aladdin quickly became a destination. Elaborate, if somewhat dated by today's standards, Arabian-themed decor created an immersive experience. The casino bustled, a sprawling showroom hosted top performers, and a golf course offered respite from the desert heat. The resort also gained iconic status as the site of Elvis Presley and Priscilla Beaulieu's (later Presley) wedding in 1967 - a moment forever etched in pop culture history. The 1976 addition of the 19-story Tower of Majesty and the Aladdin Theatre for the Performing Arts further solidified its position as a major entertainment hub.

## A Turbulent Legacy and Demise

Like many Vegas properties, the Aladdin’s story wasn’t all shimmering gold. Financial woes plagued the resort, leading to a revolving door of ownership, including a brief stint with Wayne Newton. Acquired by Japanese developer Ginji Yasuda, the hotel succumbed to bankruptcy in the late 1980s. The Aladdin officially closed its doors on November 25, 1997, and was sadly demolished in 1998. Though it was resurrected under the same name in 2000 (and subsequently renamed Planet Hollywood and now operating under Caesars Entertainment), the original Aladdin's distinctive charm and character are sorely missed by vintage Vegas enthusiasts. Its legacy serves as a reminder of a unique era on the Strip, a testament to the constant evolution and sometimes-fragile nature of Las Vegas dreams.
