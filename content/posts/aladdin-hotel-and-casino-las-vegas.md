## A Curious Beginning: From Tallyho to King’s Crown

Before shimmering silks, Arabian Nights decor, and Elvis nuptials, the location now occupied by Planet Hollywood on the Las Vegas Strip was something entirely different. In 1962, toy magnate Edwin S. Lowe, known for his novelty toys, opened the Tallyho Hotel. Picture this: an English Tudor-style resort, jarringly out of place amongst the burgeoning glitz of the Strip, with 450 rooms but…no casino. Lowe’s bold experiment of a non-gaming hotel proved unsustainable, and within a year, the Tallyho closed its doors, burdened by financial difficulties. A brief resurrection followed in 1963 as the King’s Crown Tallyho, but plans for a casino were repeatedly blocked by the Nevada Gaming Control Board due to concerns about financing – highlighting the importance of gaming licenses in the burgeoning Vegas landscape.

## The Aladdin Emerges: Arabian Nights on the Strip

The real magic began in 1966 when Milton Prell, a legend in Las Vegas development, purchased the property for around $10 million. Prell possessed a keen eye for spectacle and dramatically transformed the Tudor aesthetic into a lavish Arabian Nights fantasy. On April 1, 1966, The Aladdin Hotel and Casino officially opened its doors, instantly becoming a visual landmark. The theme was meticulous, featuring intricate mosaics, soaring minarets, and a bustling marketplace – a genuine attempt to transport guests to another world.

## Peak Aladdin: Elvis, Entertainment, and Expansion

The Aladdin quickly cemented its place in Vegas history. The hotel became a magnet for celebrity clientele, most notably hosting the iconic wedding of Elvis Presley and Priscilla Beaulieu in 1967, forever linking the resort to the King of Rock and Roll. The addition of the 19-story Tower of Majesty in 1976, along with the impressive Aladdin Theatre for the Performing Arts, further solidified its position as a premier entertainment destination. The golf course, a rare amenity on the Strip at the time, added another layer of luxury.

## Decline and Demise: A Shifting [Sands](/posts/sands-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Story

Despite its initial success, the Aladdin’s story wasn’t all magic lamps. Financial woes plagued the property, leading to a revolving door of ownership throughout the 1970s and 80s. From Parvin Dohrmann to real estate investors, and even a brief stake by Wayne Newton, the search for stability proved elusive. Ultimately acquired by Japanese developer Ginji Yasuda, the resort succumbed to bankruptcy in the late 1980s. After a final, poignant closure on November 25, 1997, the original Aladdin was demolished in 1998, paving the way for a new iteration. Though the name lived on in 2000, the modern Aladdin's own struggles led to its rebranding as Planet Hollywood, a testament to the ever-changing nature of the Las Vegas Strip and the ephemeral nature of even the most dazzling dreams. The original Aladdin's legacy remains – a vibrant reminder of a unique and ambitious chapter in vintage Las Vegas history.
