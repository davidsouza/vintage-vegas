## A New Vision for Fremont Street

The 1980s in Las Vegas were a period of transition. Downtown, long the undisputed heart of Nevada’s gambling scene, was starting to feel a little… dated. The Fremont Street Experience wasn’t even a twinkle in anyone's eye yet; it was still just a corridor of gritty casinos and nickel slots. Enter the Sundance Hotel & Casino, opening its doors on July 2, 1980, at 301 Fremont Street. It represented a bold ambition: to bring a touch of upscale sophistication to the classic Fremont Street scene.

Developed on land controlled by the legendary Moe Dalitz, a figure with deep roots in organized crime (a common, though often complicated, aspect of Las Vegas’ early development), the Sundance aimed to be different. It wasn't about dingy bars and cramped rooms. Instead, imagine a bright, modern hotel with around 650 rooms, offering a cleaner, more contemporary experience compared to its established neighbors. The sleek design and commitment to a higher standard of service marked a deliberate effort to elevate the Fremont Street experience.

## Towering Above the Competition

The Sundance didn’t just stand out in terms of decor; it physically dominated the skyline. A second tower quickly followed in 1981, briefly making the Sundance the tallest building in Nevada. This was a statement: the Sundance was here to play, and it intended to be a major player. This ambition reflected a wider trend in Vegas - a movement towards bigger, bolder, and more luxurious properties to attract a broader clientele.

## Shadows of Ownership and Regulation

The Sundance's story, however, wasn’t purely one of glittering success. Moe Dalitz, despite owning the land, was barred from direct involvement in casino operations by the Nevada Gaming Commission. This led to a complex management structure, with Al Sachs and Herb Tobman – who also managed the [Stardust](/posts/stardust-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) and Fremont casinos – stepping in. This arrangement, while initially functional, would eventually become a significant point of contention.

The troubles surfaced in 1983 when Sachs and Tobman faced suspension for allegations of skimming at the Stardust. The ensuing fallout threatened to destabilize the entire operation, and Dalitz’s attempts to regain control proved unsuccessful. Ultimately, in July 1984, veteran operator Jackie Gaughan took over gaming operations to stabilize the property while a sale was being arranged.

## A Final Transformation & Enduring Legacy

By 1987, Lincoln Management Inc. (later [Fitzgeralds](/posts/fitzgeralds-hotel-and-casino/) Gaming) purchased the Sundance. A significant renovation ensued, and in March 1988, the Sundance vanished, reborn as Fitzgeralds Hotel & Casino. Though the name changed, the location continued to be a vital part of the Fremont Street scene. 

Today, the site of the former Sundance is occupied by The D Las Vegas, a vibrant and popular destination that honors the spirit of old Vegas while embracing a modern, energetic vibe. The Sundance Hotel & Casino, though short-lived, remains a fascinating snapshot of a crucial moment in Las Vegas history – a moment when the city strived to modernize its downtown core and compete with the burgeoning Las Vegas Strip.
