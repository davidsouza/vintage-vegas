## A Vegas Institution: Foxy's Takes Root

The 1950s and 60s – a golden era for Las Vegas. The Strip was burgeoning, neon lights blazed, and the entertainment was legendary. But amidst the glitz and glamour, there existed a place where a hearty Reuben sandwich and a warm welcome were just as valuable as a jackpot. That place was Foxy’s Delicatessen, Restaurant, and Bakery, a true cornerstone of early Las Vegas culture. Located at the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and [Sahara](/posts/sahara-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Avenue (then San Francisco Avenue), Abe "Foxy" Fox’s creation opened its doors in 1955 and quickly cemented its place in Vegas history.

## More Than Just a Deli: A Hub of Community

Foxy’s wasn’t just a restaurant; it was a social hub. Operating 24 hours a day, it catered to everyone from weary construction workers to seasoned entertainers. The menu was classic New York-style deli fare: piled-high sandwiches, comforting matzo ball soup, flavorful chopped liver, and creamy egg creams. And don't forget the chocolate chiffon pie - a dessert so beloved it achieved cult status. It wasn’t fine dining, but it was honest, delicious, and served with a generous helping of personality from the friendly staff. 

What truly set Foxy’s apart, however, was its progressive spirit. During a time of segregation, it was one of the first integrated restaurants near the Strip. This meant that Black locals and celebrated Black entertainers – a demographic often excluded from casino dining rooms – could find a welcoming space to dine and socialize. This commitment to inclusivity made Foxy's more than just a restaurant, it was a symbol of a more open Las Vegas.

## Star-Studded Booths and Creative Inspiration

The walls of Foxy’s practically vibrated with celebrity energy. Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong, Don Rickles, Shecky Greene, and Liberace were regular patrons, often spotted enjoying a late-night meal or an early breakfast. Liza Minnelli and songwriter Paul Williams also frequented the deli; legend has it Williams penned songs for Bugsy Malone at one of its tables.  It fostered a sense of camaraderie between the famous and the everyday, creating a unique and memorable atmosphere. The casual, bustling environment allowed for genuine connection, something increasingly rare in the world of Las Vegas entertainment.

## The End of an Era and a Lasting Legacy

Sadly, the neon glow of Foxy’s dimmed in 1975 when Abe Fox sold the business to pursue real estate. The location was swiftly transformed into Foxy’s Firehouse Casino, marking the end of an era. Though the physical building changed, the spirit of Foxy’s lives on in Vegas lore. It stands as a reminder of a simpler time, when a good sandwich, friendly service, and a welcoming seat could bring together a cast of characters under the iconic Vegas lights. Today, a Walgreens occupies the space, a far cry from the bustling deli it once was. But for those who remember, Foxy’s remains a beloved symbol of Las Vegas’s formative years - a testament to the power of community, inclusivity, and a darn good chocolate chiffon pie.
