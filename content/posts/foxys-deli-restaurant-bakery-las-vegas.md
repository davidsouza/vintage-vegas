# Foxy’s: Where Stars and Sandwiches Met on the Las Vegas Strip

For those of us who remember the early days of Las Vegas, the name “Foxy’s Delicatessen, Restaurant, and Bakery” instantly conjures a feeling of warmth, familiarity, and a truly unique slice of Vegas history. Located at the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and [Sahara](/posts/sahara-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Avenue (then San Francisco Avenue), Foxy's wasn't just a place to eat; it was a cultural hub, a symbol of the city’s burgeoning spirit, and a testament to the power of a good Reuben sandwich.

## A New York Taste in the Desert

Abe “Foxy” Fox opened his doors in 1955, bringing the comforting flavors of a classic New York-style Jewish deli to the burgeoning Las Vegas Strip. Imagine: 24-hour service offering matzo ball soup, chopped liver, towering pastrami sandwiches, and, of course, the legendary egg creams. Foxy’s wasn’t fancy – it was bustling, friendly, and the food was exceptional. The portions were generous, the service speedy, and the atmosphere electric. But what truly set Foxy’s apart was something far more significant than just the menu.

## Breaking Barriers and Welcoming All

In an era where segregation remained a painful reality, Foxy’s stood as a beacon of inclusivity. Abe Fox made a conscious decision to welcome everyone, regardless of race. This made Foxy's one of the few places where local Black residents and celebrated Black entertainers could dine comfortably, a crucial distinction in a city where many casino dining rooms remained off-limits. This commitment to equality was as integral to Foxy's identity as the corned beef.

## A Star-Studded Clientele

The allure of Foxy’s extended far beyond its delicious food and inclusive atmosphere. The deli became a favorite haunt for a who's who of Las Vegas and Hollywood royalty. Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong, Don Rickles, Shecky Greene, and Liberace were frequently spotted enjoying a bite. Stories abound of Liza Minnelli and songwriter Paul Williams frequenting the restaurant – the latter even reportedly penned songs for Bugsy Malone at one of Foxy's tables!

## The Legacy Lives On

Sadly, Foxy’s reign came to an end in 1975 when Abe Fox sold the business to pursue real estate. The site was quickly transformed into Foxy’s Firehouse Casino, erasing the beloved deli from the landscape. Today, a Walgreens occupies the location, but the memories of Foxy’s linger. It represents a crucial and often overlooked aspect of Las Vegas's early history—a time when a simple deli could be a symbol of progress, community, and delicious food, bringing together the stars and the locals under the glow of a neon sign. Foxy's was, and remains, a vital part of the vintage Las Vegas story.
