## A Shell of a Story: La Concha’s Rise on the Strip

Few Las Vegas landmarks sparked as much awe and envy as the La Concha Motel. Opening in 1961 at 2955 Las Vegas Boulevard South, this wasn't just another roadside stop; it was a statement. Owned by M.K. Doumani, the property boasted 350 rooms and, more importantly, a lobby that redefined mid-century modern design. The genius behind this architectural marvel was Paul Revere Williams, a pioneering African American architect whose talent transcended racial barriers in a segregated era. He created a breathtaking concrete-shell lobby, instantly recognizable for its swooping curves and thin-shell design – resembling a giant seashell or a futuristic spaceship, perfectly encapsulating the optimism of the Atomic Age.

## Googie Glory & Star-Studded Stays

La Concha became synonymous with Vegas glamour. Its Googie architecture – characterized by its boomerang shapes, exaggerated angles, and neon accents – captured the spirit of the burgeoning Strip. Located between the [Riviera](/posts/riviera-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) and [Silver City](/posts/silver-city-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) (both with Williams’s touch!), La Concha was a prime destination. The motel’s guest list read like a who’s who of Hollywood: Ronald Reagan, Ann-Margret, Flip Wilson, Muhammad Ali, and the Carpenters all graced its rooms.

The lobby’s hyperbolic paraboloid form wasn't just aesthetically pleasing; it was an engineering feat. It became *the* place to be seen, and a photographer's dream. The whole design embodied the futuristic hopes and dreams of the early 60s.

## Demolition & a Lasting Legacy

Sadly, like many iconic Vegas establishments, La Concha succumbed to the pressures of a changing landscape. Rising property taxes, coupled with exorbitant “beautification” costs (a mere five palm trees reportedly cost $295,000!), made the land worth far more than the building itself. By 2004, demolition began, threatening to erase a significant piece of Las Vegas history.

Fortunately, a dedicated effort led to the preservation of the iconic lobby. Recognizing its architectural importance, the Neon Museum stepped in, painstakingly cutting the structure into eight pieces and transporting them three miles north. In 2008, it was painstakingly reassembled as the museum’s Visitors’ Center – a vibrant and poignant reminder of a bygone era. 

Today, the La Concha lobby stands as a beacon of Las Vegas’s mid-century spirit. While the motel itself is gone, replaced by an empty lot currently owned by The Siegel Group who have redevelopment plans, its legacy lives on, a testament to the vision of Paul Revere Williams and a sparkling example of Googie architecture, forever enshrined at the Neon Museum.
