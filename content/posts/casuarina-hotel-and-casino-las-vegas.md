## A Brief Life of Luxury: The Casuarina’s Story

The Las Vegas Strip has seen countless transformations, and the story of the Casuarina Hotel and Casino is a particularly poignant example of how fortunes can rise and fall in this ever-evolving city. Originally the Maxim Hotel and Casino, its brief but eventful run offers a fascinating glimpse into the early 2000s Las Vegas landscape, a time of booming growth followed by a devastating recession. 

The Maxim, built in 1997, was a solid mid-tier casino hotel trying to find its niche. It was never a destination property in the same vein as the Bellagio or the Mirage. But in 2002, Columbia Sussex Hospitality stepped in, acquiring the property for $38 million and envisioning something more upscale. They set out to create a Las Vegas resort unlike any other Westin in the U.S.

## The Westin Casuarina: A Caribbean Vibe on the Strip

The ambitious renovation, costing a reported $90 million, was inspired by the Westin’s successful Casuarina resort in Grand Cayman. The new Westin Casuarina Hotel and Casino, which debuted on November 6, 2003, aimed to transport guests to a luxurious, tropical paradise. It was the first Westin resort in the U.S. to include a casino and marked the brand’s debut in Nevada.  The design incorporated lush landscaping, a relaxed atmosphere, and an emphasis on guest comfort. It was a deliberate departure from the often-over-the-top themed experiences dominating the Strip at the time. While the casino certainly brought in revenue, the Westin focused on the overall resort experience. 

## A Sudden Downfall and Transformation

The good times, however, were not to last. The 2008 financial crisis hit Las Vegas hard, severely impacting tourism and property values. By 2010, Columbia Sussex struggled to meet the $160 million mortgage on the property, leading to a foreclosure filing. Despite attempts to restructure, the situation deteriorated. In October 2011, Columbia Sussex relinquished the property, succumbing to the pressures of a rapidly changing economic climate.

Following the foreclosure, a series of changes ensued. Pyramid Hotel Group took over operations, leasing the casino to 777 Gaming.  The hotel was rebranded as The Westin Las Vegas, signaling a decisive shift away from the gambling focus. The casino floor, once a vibrant hub of activity, was significantly reduced to make way for expanded hotel amenities, including a destination spa. 

## Legacy: A Quiet Retreat

Today, the building stands as a quieter, more refined retreat on the Strip. The casino is gone, replaced by contemporary meeting spaces and a popular restaurant. While the Westin Casuarina's life as a casino was fleeting, it left a unique mark on Las Vegas history. It represents a bold attempt to infuse the Strip with a more relaxed, tropical ambiance, and serves as a reminder of the fragility of even the most ambitious ventures in the ever-shifting landscape of Las Vegas.
