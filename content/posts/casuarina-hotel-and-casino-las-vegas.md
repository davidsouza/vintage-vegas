## A New Kid on the Strip: The Maxim Era

Before it became the Westin, and before that, the Casuarina, the property we know today was the [Maxim Hotel and Casino](/posts/maxim-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/). Opened in 1990, the Maxim was a bold attempt to capture a younger, more hip clientele – a move away from the traditional glitz and glamor of many Strip hotels. It was designed with a contemporary aesthetic and marketed aggressively, targeting a more casual visitor. While it never quite achieved the iconic status of its neighbors, it carved out a niche, especially during the early 90s. 

## The Westin Casuarina: A Caribbean Dream on the Las Vegas Strip

In 2002, Columbia Sussex purchased the Maxim for $38 million, envisioning a significant transformation. They spent a hefty $90 million on renovations, re-branding it as The Westin Casuarina Hotel and Casino in November 2003. The name was a nod to Westin’s successful resort in the Cayman Islands, bringing a tropical, relaxed vibe to the Las Vegas Strip. This was a significant moment – the first Westin resort in the U.S. to feature a casino and the first Westin property to call Nevada home. The casino itself was a bright, modern space, intended to complement the resort's overall theme. The initial reception was positive, offering a unique alternative for visitors.

## A Brief, Turbulent Run & Foreclosure

The Westin Casuarina's story, however, wasn’t destined for a long and prosperous run. The 2008 financial crisis hit Las Vegas hard, and the hotel, burdened by a $160 million mortgage, fell into foreclosure in 2010. Columbia Sussex struggled to keep up with payments, and the property became another casualty of the economic downturn.  By 2011, the inevitable happened. The hotel was transferred to new management under the Pyramid Hotel Group, and the casino operations were leased to 777 Gaming.  The name was officially changed to The Westin Las Vegas.

## Transformation and a Focus on Wellness

Recognizing the changing landscape of the Las Vegas Strip, The Westin Las Vegas dramatically reduced its casino footprint. The space once occupied by gaming tables was repurposed for expanded hotel amenities, most notably a destination spa. This shift reflected a growing demand for wellness and relaxation, moving away from the traditional casino-centric model. Today, the Westin Las Vegas operates as a non-gaming resort, boasting updated meeting spaces and a popular restaurant. While the casino is a distant memory, the property’s journey through rebranding and reinvention underscores the constant evolution of the Las Vegas Strip – a testament to its resilience and adaptability.  The Casuarina’s legacy, though brief, highlights a fascinating chapter in vintage Las Vegas history, showcasing a bold experiment in blending Caribbean luxury with the energy of the Strip.
