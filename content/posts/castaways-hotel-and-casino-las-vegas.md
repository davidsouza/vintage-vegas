## A Brief Tropical Escape on the Strip

Before the mega-resorts and the dazzling spectacle that defines modern Las Vegas, there were properties like the Castaways Hotel & Casino, each with its own unique story. Tucked away on the Strip, the Castaways, born from the ashes of the financially troubled Sans Souci in 1963, offered a fleeting taste of Polynesian paradise to weary travelers. Ben Jaffe, a prominent Las Vegas investor and then-owner of the Tropicana, acquired the Sans Souci and immediately envisioned a transformation.

## Polynesian Promise & Early Struggles

The rebranding to Castaways was more than just a name change; it was a promise of an escape. Lush landscaping, tiki bars, and a distinct Polynesian theme were intended to create a unique ambiance. Ike P. LaRue and Everett Eugene McCarlie ran the casino, hoping to draw in crowds. However, the early days proved challenging. Despite construction of new rooms and renovations, financial difficulties plagued the operation, leading to the casino's closure just fifteen months after opening in December 1964. The hotel component, however, managed to persevere.

## Howard Hughes' Intervention & A New Chapter

The Castaways’ fortunes took a dramatic turn when Howard Hughes stepped in. His purchase, finalized in October 1967 for $3.3 million, signaled a period of stability and strategic investment. Hughes, known for his shrewd business acumen, recognized the potential of the location. He significantly upgraded the property, adding a larger showroom stage in 1969, crucial for attracting big-name entertainment, and embarking on further casino renovations in 1971 and again in 1981.

## A Final Curtain & A Mega-Resort’s Dawn

The Castaways’ relatively short lifespan concluded in 1987 when Steve Wynn acquired it for a substantial $50 million. Wynn’s vision extended far beyond the existing property. The Castaways was destined to be demolished, making way for his ambitious new resort: The Mirage. This marked a pivotal moment in Las Vegas history, ushering in the era of mega-resorts and fundamentally altering the Strip’s landscape. The Mirage, opening in November 1989, was a game-changer, establishing a new standard for spectacle and scale. 

While the Castaways is long gone, its brief but vibrant existence serves as a poignant reminder of a different era in Las Vegas history - an era of smaller, more intimate resorts striving to carve out their niche on the legendary Strip.
