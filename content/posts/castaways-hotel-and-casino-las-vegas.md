## A Brief But Bright Polynesian Escape

The Las Vegas Strip has seen countless resorts rise and fall, each leaving a unique mark on its ever-evolving landscape. Few, however, have a story as peculiar and bittersweet as the Castaways Hotel and Casino. Existing from 1963 to 1987, it occupied the northwest corner of the Strip at Harmon Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard – a spot now dominated by The Mirage. But before the volcano erupted and the dolphin show debuted, a Polynesian-themed oasis briefly charmed visitors and locals alike.

The Castaways didn't start as Castaways. It began life as the Sans Souci Hotel, a financially troubled property bought in 1963 by Ben Jaffe, who also owned the Tropicana. Recognizing its potential, Jaffe envisioned a complete transformation, rebranding it as the Castaways and adding rooms and a much-needed facelift. The concept was clear: a tropical escape in the middle of the Nevada desert.

## Turbulent Waters & A Big Name Arrival

The revamped Castaways officially opened its doors on September 1, 1963, boasting a casino overseen by Ike P. LaRue and Everett Eugene McCarlie. The casino, initially the property’s strength, faced its own struggles and shut down surprisingly quickly, only lasting until December 3, 1964. While the hotel itself continued to operate, the casino’s closure signaled an uncertain future.

Then came Howard Hughes. In a move that would become characteristic of his Las Vegas investments, Hughes acquired the Castaways in 1967 for $3.3 million. Hughes, ever the innovator, saw value where others didn't.  He expanded the showroom for larger productions and initiated renovations in 1971 and again in 1981, attempting to revitalize the property and update its aging charm. These efforts, while extending the Castaways' lifespan, weren't enough to secure its long-term viability.

## A Demise and a Legacy

The final chapter arrived in 1986 when Steve Wynn purchased the Castaways for a substantial $50 million. Wynn, known for his ambitious visions, had grand plans for the land.  The Castaways officially closed on July 20, 1987, with 228 rooms and a workforce of 650.  Its demolition paved the way for The Mirage, a landmark mega-resort that irrevocably transformed the Las Vegas Strip, introducing a new scale and thematic extravagance to the desert landscape.

While the Castaways itself is gone, its story serves as a fascinating reminder of the Strip's volatile history – a testament to the ever-changing tides of fortune and the relentless pursuit of the next big thing. It represents a time when smaller, themed resorts still had a place on the Las Vegas landscape, before the era of mega-resorts truly took hold. Its brief existence left a small but indelible mark on vintage Las Vegas.
