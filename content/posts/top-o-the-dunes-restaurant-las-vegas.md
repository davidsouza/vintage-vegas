## A Bird's-Eye View of Old Vegas

The Las Vegas Strip has always been about spectacle, but few experiences rivaled the magic of dining at Top O’ The [Dunes](/posts/dunes-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Restaurant. Perched atop the Dunes Hotel & Casino’s 21-story “Diamond of the Dunes” tower, opening initially as “Top O’ The Strip” in June 1965, this wasn’t just a restaurant; it was an event. Imagine: a sophisticated, dimly lit room, plush seating, and, most importantly, panoramic views stretching across the Strip, downtown, and the vast Nevada desert – a truly unparalleled vista.

## Fine Dining & Fabulous Entertainment

Top O’ The Strip quickly established itself as a premier destination. The menu reflected the era: upscale Continental and Italian-inspired dishes were the norm, with steaks, seafood, veal, and pasta prepared with tableside flair. This was fine dining in the truest sense, where impeccable service and a sense of occasion were paramount.  It wasn’t about speed; it was about savoring the moment – the food, the company, and that breathtaking view. 

Beyond the cuisine, the lounge area was a hub for live entertainment. Many a Vegas local recalls enjoying performances from iconic artists like Nancy Sinatra and the legendary Sonny King, all while hundreds of feet above the bustling Strip. It was a unique combination of culinary excellence and Vegas showmanship.

## Rebranding and Enduring Popularity

In 1979, as the Dunes sought to further solidify its Arabian-fantasy theme, Top O’ The Strip was rebranded as Top O’ The Dunes. The name change, while subtle, aligned the restaurant more seamlessly with the hotel’s overall aesthetic.  Despite the rise of increasingly extravagant megaresorts in the 1980s, Top O’ The Dunes remained a beloved classic. It was *the* place for anniversaries, proposals, and any celebration that deserved an unforgettable backdrop. It represented a bygone era of Vegas “gourmet rooms” - a slower pace, a focus on presentation, and an unmatched level of elegance.

## A Lost Treasure

The Dunes Hotel & Casino, and with it, Top O’ The Dunes, closed its doors in 1993.  The hotel was subsequently demolished to make way for the Bellagio, a decision that marked a significant shift in the Strip’s landscape.  While the physical space is gone, the memories of Top O’ The Dunes Restaurant persist. Vintage menus, photographs, and the recollections of Las Vegas veterans keep its legacy alive – a testament to a time when dinner came with a side of neon, a sweeping desert horizon, and a truly unforgettable experience. It serves as a potent reminder of the glamorous, sophisticated history of Las Vegas.
