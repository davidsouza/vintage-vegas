## A Convention Center Stalwart: The Royal's Early Days

Just a stone's throw east of the legendary Las Vegas Strip, at 99 Convention Center Drive, stood a hotel with a story uniquely intertwined with the city’s booming convention business. Originally opening in 1970 as Royal Las Vegas, it was part of the Royal Executive Inns chain, a budget-friendly option catering to the growing influx of business travelers. Unlike its glitzy Strip counterparts, the Royal aimed to provide reliable, affordable lodging – a vital service as the Las Vegas Convention Center became an increasingly important economic driver.

## From Hotel to Royal Casino: Adding a Touch of Gaming

The early 1970s marked a significant shift for the Royal. Recognizing an opportunity to draw in convention attendees and offer a little extra entertainment, a small casino was added around 1973. The name officially changed to the Royal Casino, signaling this new direction. However, it wasn't about competing with the grandeur of the Strip. Instead, it presented a modest, accessible gaming experience alongside comfortable rooms – a truly unique proposition.

## A Quiet Gaming Niche

For decades, the Royal Casino occupied a quiet but persistent role in the Las Vegas landscape. Reports suggest it held a relatively small footprint, often cited as around 100 slot machines and a couple of blackjack tables. This wasn’t a high-roller playground; it was a spot for convention-goers to unwind and try their luck after a long day of meetings. It cleverly carved a niche, avoiding direct confrontation with the major casino resorts while capitalizing on its prime location.

## Evolution and Decline: Royal Hotel, Resort, and Ultimately Closure

Through the early 1990s, the property evolved again, becoming the Royal Hotel and Casino. Later, it transitioned to Royal Resort, shedding its casino operations around 2003 and focusing solely on hotel services. The decision reflected a broader shift in the Las Vegas market and demonstrated the property's ability to adapt, albeit to a reduced scale. A devastating fire in 2022, triggering the building's sprinkler system and causing widespread water damage, ultimately sealed its fate.

## A Legacy of Quiet Endurance

Today, the Royal Resort at 99 Convention Center Drive is facing demolition after a liquidation sale in mid-2025. Its story isn't one of dazzling neon or extravagant shows. Instead, it’s a story of quiet endurance – a property built to support Las Vegas’s convention traffic, weathering decades of change, and providing an economical option for countless visitors. The Royal's legacy is a poignant reminder of the diverse and often understated history of Las Vegas, a city built not only on spectacle but also on the vital service of providing comfort and convenience.
