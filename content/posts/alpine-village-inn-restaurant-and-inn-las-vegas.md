## A Little Bavaria in the Desert

The Las Vegas Strip has seen its share of themed restaurants come and go, but few left a mark as indelible as the Alpine Village Inn. From its humble beginnings in 1950, this wasn't just a place to eat; it was a full-blown immersive experience, a little slice of Bavaria and Switzerland transplanted into the burgeoning desert landscape. Founded by Ray Dambach and Pauline Remmert at 905 North Las Vegas Boulevard, the Inn’s initial menu of traditional German and Swiss fare - think sauerkraut, schnitzel, and hearty potato pancakes – filled a niche in a city still finding its culinary footing.

## Multiple Moves and a Fiery Chapter

The Inn’s story is one of constant evolution, marked by several relocations. Within three years, it moved to Maryland Parkway near [Tropicana](/posts/tropicana-country-club-las-vegas/), then to a prime location across from the [Stardust](/posts/stardust-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) at the Desert Spa Shopping Center in 1959. However, 1961 brought a setback: a devastating fire forced another relocation to 4375 South Las Vegas Boulevard.  It was the 1970 move that solidified the Alpine Village Inn's iconic status. Situated directly opposite the [Las Vegas Hilton](/posts/las-vegas-hilton-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) (now the Westgate) at 3003 [Paradise](/posts/paradise-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Road, this final location became synonymous with the restaurant itself. 

## A Rathskeller and Chalet Charm

What truly set the Alpine Village Inn apart was its atmosphere. The upper dining room was a whimsical fairytale brought to life. Miniature trains chugged through Alpine landscapes painted on the walls, Swiss cuckoo clocks ticked merrily, and servers were decked out in traditional lederhosen and dirndls. Downstairs, the Rathskeller – a German-style tavern – was the true heart of the experience. Communal tables fostered camaraderie, peanuts were tossed on the floor (a fun and messy tradition!), and popcorn was offered freely. The lively oompah bands and sing-along evenings made the Rathskeller “where it was at” – a vibrant hub of spirited revelry unlike anything else on the Strip.  Don't forget the beloved, and still-remembered, cottage cheese dip and creamy chicken soup served in pewter bowls!

## A Legacy Lost, But Not Forgotten

For nearly 27 years, the Alpine Village Inn was a beloved institution, welcoming politicians, tourists, and locals alike into its uniquely welcoming environment.  The passing of majority owner Lou Wiener in the mid-’90s, combined with the mounting costs of maintaining the aging Paradise Road building, ultimately led to its closure. In March 1997, the doors closed, and a chapter of vintage Las Vegas history ended. An auction dispersed the charming decor and memorabilia, and sadly, the building itself was demolished, replaced by a Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Convention Center. While the physical space is gone, the memories and the unique character of the Alpine Village Inn live on, a cherished part of Las Vegas’s vibrant and evolving past.
