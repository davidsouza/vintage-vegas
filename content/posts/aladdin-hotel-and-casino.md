# Remembering the Magic of the Aladdin Hotel and Casino

The Las Vegas Strip has seen countless transformations over the decades, but few disappearances were as dramatic as the original Aladdin Hotel and Casino. Opening its doors at midnight on April 1, 1966, at 3667 South Las Vegas Blvd, the Aladdin wasn’t just another casino; it was a full-fledged theatrical experience transported to the desert.

## A Desert Arabian Dream

The Aladdin's theme was instantly striking: an opulent, Arabesque design. Lush carpets, towering brass lamps, and elaborate mosaics transported guests to a fantastical Middle Eastern world. The centerpiece was a massive, working stagecoach that would dramatically descend from the hotel's façade, carrying guests down a miniature “desert” landscape into the casino. This elaborate spectacle was a major draw and a quintessential element of the 1960s Vegas showmanship.

## Elvis Says 'I Do'

Just a year after its debut, the Aladdin cemented its place in entertainment history. In May 1967, the hotel hosted the wedding of rock and roll royalty, Elvis Presley, and Priscilla Beaulieu. The event, shrouded in secrecy and attended by family and close friends, remains a legendary moment in both Elvis lore and Las Vegas history. Photos of the couple exiting the Aladdin are instantly recognizable and continue to evoke the glamour of the era.

## The Rise and Fall (and Implosion!)

The Aladdin remained a Strip staple for over three decades, evolving with the changing times. However, the late 1990s brought about significant changes. In 1998, after years of financial struggles and a desire to modernize the property, a decision was made to demolish the original tower. The implosion, a spectacle in its own right, captivated audiences worldwide. The dramatic collapse of the Aladdin’s distinctive tower marked a definitive end to an era.

## A Brief Second Act & A Lasting Legacy

A new, much larger Aladdin resort rose from the ashes in August 2000, attempting to recapture the magic of the original. Sadly, it too faced financial hardship and filed for bankruptcy in September 2001. After a series of ownership changes, the property was eventually purchased by Planet Hollywood and Starwood Resorts. Today, it operates under the Planet Hollywood name. 

Though the original Aladdin is gone, its legacy lives on. It stands as a powerful reminder of a bygone era of Vegas extravagance, theatrical showmanship, and a touch of desert fantasy – a truly unique chapter in the vibrant history of the Las Vegas Strip.
