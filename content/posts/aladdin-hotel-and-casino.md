## A Midnight Beginning & an Arabian Dream

The Las Vegas Strip wasn’t always the neon playground we know today. Back in the 1960s, it was evolving, hungry for bigger, bolder attractions. Enter the [Aladdin Hotel and Casino](/posts/aladdin-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), a sprawling spectacle that burst onto the scene at midnight on April 1, 1966. Located at 3667 South Las Vegas Blvd, the Aladdin aimed for something different: an opulent, Arabian-themed experience. Forget the Western or futuristic themes – this was a journey to a fictional desert palace, complete with mosaic tilework, lush landscaping (at least initially), and costumed performers.

The Aladdin was the brainchild of Bruce Eichner and Milton Prell, and the design was intended to evoke a sense of exoticism and grandeur. The architecture, while somewhat kitschy by modern standards, was undeniably striking for the era.  Inside, elaborate fountains, theatrical lighting, and oriental rugs transported guests to what was envisioned as a romantic fantasy world. The hotel's distinctive, gold-domed silhouette made it instantly recognizable on the Strip.

## Elvis Says "I Do" & Early Challenges

The Aladdin’s star rose quickly, and it solidified its place in Vegas lore in May 1967. It was the site of the legendary wedding of Elvis Presley and Priscilla Beaulieu. The intimate ceremony, held in the Aladdin’s Chapel of the Desert, was a media sensation, adding instant cachet to the hotel. This cemented the Aladdin’s status as a prime celebrity destination.

However, the early years weren't all glitz and glamour. Financial difficulties plagued the Aladdin throughout its existence.  Ownership changed hands multiple times, and the casino struggled to compete with the rapidly evolving landscape of the Las Vegas Strip. Attempts to revamp the theme and offerings were often short-lived. Despite the initial lavishness, the landscaping began to fade and the once-vibrant atmosphere grew tired.

## Demolition & Rebirth… and Then More Trouble

The final chapter of the original Aladdin arrived dramatically on April 27, 1998. After years of declining performance and failed attempts at revitalization, the decision was made to demolish the 32-story hotel tower.  The implosion was a spectacle in itself, watched by thousands and captured on television around the world. A new, significantly larger Aladdin resort was planned to rise from the ashes, promising a modern interpretation of the Arabian theme.

That new Aladdin, which opened in August 2000, ultimately proved to be another expensive gamble. While initially popular, it, too, faced financial hardship and filed for bankruptcy less than a year later. The property passed through various hands, eventually being purchased by Planet Hollywood and Starwood Resorts.

## A Legacy of "What If?"

Today, the Aladdin name is gone. The site is now Planet Hollywood, a testament to the constant flux and reinvention that characterizes the Las Vegas Strip. While the original Aladdin’s opulent, albeit somewhat dated, Arabian Nights fantasy is a distant memory, its legacy remains. It represents a specific era of Las Vegas, a time when themed resorts were still a relatively new concept, and when even the most extravagant dreams could crumble beneath the weight of changing tastes and financial pressures. The implosion itself became a Las Vegas legend, a powerful visual symbol of the city’s relentless pursuit of the next big thing.
