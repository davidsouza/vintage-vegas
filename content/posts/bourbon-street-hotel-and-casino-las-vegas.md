## From Shenandoah to the Big Easy: A Brief History

Before it became the vibrant, if somewhat compact, Bourbon Street Hotel & Casino, the property at 120 E. Flamingo Road in Las Vegas bore a different name: the [Shenandoah Hotel](/posts/shenandoah-hotel-las-vegas/). Opened in 1980, the Shenandoah was struggling, and it seemed destined for obscurity. However, a shift in Nevada law in 1985 – allowing foreign ownership of gaming operations – created a pivotal opportunity. Canadian real estate firm Carma Developers (then Allarco Holdings) recognized the potential and swooped in, transforming the struggling Shenandoah into the New Orleans-themed Bourbon Street Hotel & Casino. 

## A Taste of New Orleans on the Strip

Bourbon Street debuted in 1985 and offered a refreshing contrast to the increasingly grandiose mega-resorts sprouting along the Strip. It boasted a festive, Crescent City facade and a cozy, intimate atmosphere. The casino itself, encompassing around 15,000 square feet, offered a selection of slots and table games, initially peaking around 420 slots and 15 tables by 1995. The 166 hotel rooms were simple but welcoming, appealing to local players and value-oriented visitors who didn’t necessarily want the full spectacle of a major casino. It carved out a niche by offering a more personal and accessible gaming experience. 

## Ownership Changes and a Slow Decline

The Bourbon Street’s history was marked by a series of ownership changes. It was initially sold to Hotel Investors Trust in 1988, and there were even near misses with potential acquisitions by Crown Casino and Florida Gaming. In 1996, Tarsadia Hotels purchased the property and, a significant blow to the Bourbon Street identity, closed the casino. While the hotel continued to operate, it lost a core part of its charm. Subsequent ownership attempts and eyes from various companies like Edge Resorts proved short-lived. 

## A Sudden End & Lasting Legacy

Ultimately, Harrah’s Entertainment acquired Bourbon Street in March 2005 for over $60 million, a testament to the prime location. However, before Harrah’s could implement their plans, a catastrophic water main break on October 18, 2005, forced an abrupt and early closure. The planned closure for October 31st became moot. The final chapter arrived on February 14, 2006, when the building was imploded. 

Though a relatively small player on the Las Vegas landscape, Bourbon Street Hotel & Casino remains a poignant symbol of a specific era – a time when smaller, themed casinos could thrive on the Strip. Today, a Harrah's parking lot occupies the site, a quiet memorial to a unique and memorable Vegas experience – a little bit of New Orleans lost to the relentless march of mega-resort development.
