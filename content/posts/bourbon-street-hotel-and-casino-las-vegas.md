## From Shenandoah to the Big Easy: A Tale of Two Hotels

For those of us who remember a slightly different Las Vegas, a quieter, more intimate Strip, the Bourbon Street Hotel & Casino holds a special place. Located at 120 E. Flamingo Road, its story is a microcosm of the evolution of gaming and tourism in the city. It wasn't always Bourbon Street, though. Prior to 1985, the site was home to the Shenandoah Hotel, a venture that didn’t quite capture the Vegas magic and ultimately floundered.

Then came a game-changing moment: Nevada’s 1985 law permitted foreign ownership of gaming operations. Canadian real estate firm Carma Developers (formerly Allarco Holdings) saw an opportunity, snatching up the Shenandoah and transforming it into the wonderfully themed Bourbon Street Hotel & Casino. This rebirth injected new life into the property, adding a 15,000-square-foot casino floor complete with slots and table games alongside 166 cozy rooms.

## A Taste of New Orleans on Flamingo Road

What set Bourbon Street apart wasn't its size (it was a relatively modest player on the Strip), but its distinct charm. The New Orleans theme was genuinely embraced, creating a festive and welcoming atmosphere. It catered to a different clientele than the mega-resorts – a focus on locals and value-oriented visitors seeking a less overwhelming experience. In the early years, it boasted around 420 slots and 15 table games, offering a genuine taste of the Crescent City right in the heart of Las Vegas.

## Ownership Changes and a Short, Turbulent Life

Bourbon Street’s history was anything but stable. Ownership changed hands multiple times throughout the 1990s and early 2000s – Hotel Investors Trust, a near acquisition by Crown Casino, Tarsadia Hotels (who briefly closed the casino), even a brief look from Florida Gaming. Each change brought shifts in strategy and direction. Finally, in March 2005, Harrah’s Entertainment purchased the property for over $60 million, signaling its ultimate fate.

## An Unexpected End and a Quiet Legacy

Ironically, it wasn’t the planned demolition that ended Bourbon Street’s run. A devastating water-main break on October 18, 2005, forced an abrupt closure well before the scheduled October 31st date. The implosion that followed on February 14, 2006, marked the end of an era. 

Today, all that remains is a Harrah's parking lot, a seemingly unremarkable space. But for those who remember, Bourbon Street stands as a poignant reminder of a time when Las Vegas wasn’t just about mega-resorts and spectacle, but also about unique, intimate experiences, and the ever-shifting landscape of the Las Vegas Strip.
