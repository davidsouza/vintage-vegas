## A Brief Reign: The Monaco Motel (and its Royal Suite)

Few Las Vegas properties are as fleetingly remembered as the Monaco Motel, located at 3073 South Las Vegas Boulevard. While it wasn't one of the glamorous, headline-grabbing casinos on the main Strip, its story, however brief, offers a glimpse into the burgeoning motel landscape of the late 1950s and early 1990s. It opened its doors in 1958, a time when South Las Vegas Boulevard was still developing and the city's tourism industry was rapidly expanding.

The Monaco Motel wasn’t vying for high-roller attention. It was a roadside stop, catering to families and travelers passing through. It operated as a motel with a small casino, aiming to capture a slice of the burgeoning gambling market.

## The Royal Connection - A Touch of Monaco Magic

What truly distinguishes the Monaco Motel from other forgotten properties is the intriguing, if somewhat manufactured, connection to the Principality of Monaco. While no direct link existed between the motel’s ownership and Prince Rainier III or Princess Grace, the owners cleverly reserved a “Royal Suite” exclusively for the royal couple should they ever grace Las Vegas with a visit. This was a brilliant marketing tactic – a nod to the European glamour that many Las Vegas establishments were trying to emulate. It’s unclear if the Prince and Princess ever utilized the suite, but the legend stuck, adding a touch of regal allure to the property.

## A Demise and a Legacy

Despite a respectable run of over three decades, the Monaco Motel's story ended abruptly. It permanently closed its doors in 1993, a victim of changing times and the relentless march of progress on the Las Vegas Strip. Just a year later, in 1994, the property was demolished to make way for the Desert Inn Road Super Arterial project, a major road expansion aimed at easing traffic congestion.

Today, the land where the Monaco Motel once stood is occupied by the sprawling Encore Hotel and Casino – a testament to how drastically the Las Vegas landscape has transformed. While the Monaco Motel is gone, its brief but memorable chapter serves as a reminder of the countless smaller businesses that contributed to the unique character of vintage Las Vegas, and the clever strategies used to stand out in a fiercely competitive market. It’s a quiet story, buried beneath the glitz and glamour of modern mega-resorts, but a worthwhile one to remember when reflecting on the rich and layered history of Las Vegas.
