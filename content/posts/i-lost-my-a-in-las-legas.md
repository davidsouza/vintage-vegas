## A Matchbook Mystery: “I Lost My A in Las Vegas”

Vintage Las Vegas ephemera is a treasure trove for history buffs like myself. Recently, a particularly intriguing piece surfaced: a matchbook declaring, "I Lost My A in Las Vegas." While the phrase itself is playfully cryptic (referring, undoubtedly, to a significant loss – financial or otherwise!), the real fascination lies in the list of participating hotels emblazoned inside. This wasn't just a clever marketing slogan; it was a promotional tie-in showcasing the major players of the Las Vegas Strip in the 1970s.

## A Star-Studded List of Hotels

Let’s break down that impressive roster. We’re talking a veritable who’s who of classic Las Vegas resorts. The Union Plaza, a historic landmark, stood alongside the glitzy Sahara, still in its relatively early years of operation. The Desert Inn, a Howard Hughes creation, was at its peak, known for its understated elegance. The Riviera, with its sophisticated vibe, felt like a slice of the French Riviera transplanted to the desert. Of course, the Flamingo, a legendary name thanks to its association with Bugsy Siegel, was always a Strip staple.

Then there’s the MGM Grand (the *first* MGM Grand, not the behemoth we know today), the Dunes (sadly, demolished to make way for Bellagio), the Hacienda (another casualty of progress, though its neon sign lives on), Circus Circus (a family-friendly phenomenon!), the Sands (home to the infamous “Rat Pack” era), the Las Vegas Hilton (a powerhouse known for its celebrity headliners), the Frontier Hotel (a pioneer of the Strip), the Aladdin (with its Arabian Nights theme), Caesars Palace (a Roman empire rising from the desert), the Stardust, and finally, the Tropicana, showcasing a tropical paradise feel. 

## The 1970s: An Era of Excess and Innovation

This matchbook is a snapshot of a specific era – the 1970s. This decade marked a significant shift for Las Vegas. The city was embracing extravagance and theatricality. Hotels were getting bigger, shows were becoming more spectacular, and the overall vibe was one of unapologetic indulgence. The "I Lost My A" tagline perfectly captures the feeling of risk and potential reward that permeated the experience. It acknowledges the possibility of failure (losing your “A,” representing something valuable) but implies a thrilling, larger-than-life adventure.

## A Promotion's Lost Connection & The Legacy of the Strip

The existence of a matching cover, “I Made It Big in Las Vegas,” further piques the mystery. Were these two intended as a pair, highlighting the contrasting fortunes one could experience on the Strip? Or were they separate promotional pieces? We may never know for sure.

Regardless, this "I Lost My A in Las Vegas" matchbook serves as a charming reminder of a bygone era. It’s a tangible link to the history of the Las Vegas Strip – a time when glamour, risk, and a touch of playful cynicism reigned supreme.  It demonstrates just how interwoven the fortunes of Las Vegas were with the hotels that shaped its identity. These properties, many now gone or dramatically altered, defined an era of Las Vegas history, and this little matchbook provides a tiny window into that fascinating past.
