## A Constant State of Change on Fremont Street

The early to mid-1950s were a period of intense growth and constant evolution for Las Vegas. Fremont Street, then *the* Strip, was a battleground for smaller casinos vying for tourist dollars. Among these was a venue at 109 Fremont Street that, while having a relatively short lifespan, packed a whole lot of Las Vegas history into its existence. Originally the Santa Anita Turf Club, it transformed into the Nevada Club in July 1953, instantly establishing itself as part of the burgeoning downtown scene.

## The Nevada Club & a Lucky Merger

The Nevada Club quickly gained a reputation for a fun, energetic atmosphere, a crucial ingredient for attracting visitors seeking an exciting downtown experience. It even boldly promoted itself as "the world's most exciting casino," a claim backed by the promise of a jackpot every 27 seconds – a truly impressive (and likely strategically inflated!) statistic for the time. In late 1955, things shifted again when Robert Van Santen, owner of the Fortune Club, merged his operation with the Nevada Club. The Nevada Club name remained, signifying a powerful combination of resources and a boost in popularity. Van Santen’s continued ownership solidified its position in the competitive Fremont Street landscape.

## The Diamond Jim Era: Neon and Jackpots

The most recognizable era for this building arrived in 1962 with the rebranding to Diamond Jim’s Nevada Club. The name evoked a sense of luxury and spectacle, perfectly complementing the casino’s flashy neon signage which helped define the “Glitter Gulch” era of Fremont Street. Think vibrant, eye-catching colors, and a pulsating energy that drew people in. The promised jackpots continued to be a significant draw, further fueling the casino's appeal.

## Expansion and Absorption by the Golden Nugget

The mid-to-late 1960s saw a wave of consolidation in Las Vegas. The burgeoning Golden Nugget, under the ambitious ownership of Steve Wynn, began a westward expansion that would dramatically reshape Fremont Street. In 1967, Diamond Jim’s Nevada Club took on another transformation when it merged with the neighboring Lucky Casino/Lucky Strike Club, adopting the name Lucky Nevada Club.  This arrangement lasted until about 1969.  However, the writing was on the wall.  The Golden Nugget's expansion plan inevitably swallowed up the smaller venues, and Diamond Jim’s Nevada Club (and the Lucky Nevada Club) were absorbed into the Nugget’s massive property.  By late 1969 or early 1970, the original building closed permanently.

## A Legacy in Memorabilia and Memory

Though its run was brief, Diamond Jim's Nevada Club left a lasting mark. Today, the site is part of the sprawling Golden Nugget complex, unrecognizable to those who remember its neon glow and the promises of quickjackpots. But its legacy lives on through collectors who eagerly trade Diamond Jim's chips and matchbooks, tangible reminders of a vibrant era.  It serves as a key snapshot of a crucial period in Las Vegas history – a time of fierce competition, rapid development, and the iconic neon signs that made Fremont Street legendary.
