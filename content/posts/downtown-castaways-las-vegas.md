## From Showboat to Castaways: A Name Change and a Rocky Start

Downtown Las Vegas has seen its share of transitions, but few were as fleeting and ultimately tragic as the story of the Castaways. It all began in 1998 when Harrah’s Entertainment acquired the Showboat Hotel and Casino. However, Harrah’s, needing to maintain the Showboat name for their Atlantic City property, quickly sold the downtown location just two years later. This sale, for $23.5 million, brought in VSS Enterprises, led by Dan Shaw, Mike Villamor, and Greg Schatzman, who were tasked with rebranding the property.

Thus, the Showboat became the Castaways. The new name was meant to evoke a sense of adventure and escape, but the reality proved far less glamorous.

## A Cascade of Challenges

The Castaways’ run was plagued from the start. The late 1990s and early 2000s were a tough period for Las Vegas, and the property was particularly vulnerable. The post-9/11 tourism slump delivered a devastating blow. A planned $57 million expansion into a Holiday Inn fell through, a sign of the underlying financial strain. Things spiraled further when VSS defaulted on a $20 million mortgage.

In 2003, Castaways filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, carrying a staggering debt of up to $100 million. A judge’s ruling highlighting financial mismanagement ultimately sealed its fate, and on January 29, 2004, the doors officially closed.

## Demolition and a Lingering License

The property’s future remained uncertain for a while. It changed hands a few times, with plans for a Latino-themed resort (La Joya del Sol) ultimately sidelined. Station Casinos eventually stepped in, motivated primarily by the valuable grandfathered gaming license the site possessed. The aging buildings were deemed structurally unsound, leading to a dramatic implosion of the hotel tower on January 11, 2006 - a fittingly spectacular end to a short and troubled existence.

## A Full Circle and a Wildfire Revival

While plans for a Spanish-themed Station Casino (“Castaways Station”) never materialized, the valuable gaming license remained a crucial asset. For years, a small, portable casino was opened periodically to satisfy state regulations. In 2023, Station Casinos finally brought a new iteration of a casino to the land, a Wildfire-branded casino, marking a peculiar return to the site's original gaming purpose. The legacy of the Castaways, however, remains a cautionary tale of ambition, misfortune, and the ever-changing landscape of Downtown Las Vegas.
