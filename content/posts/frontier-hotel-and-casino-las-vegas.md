## A Rollercoaster of Names and Ownership: The Frontier's Tumultuous Past

Before the glittering megaresorts, before the themed hotels, the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip was home to a place that epitomized the raw, frontier spirit of the burgeoning desert city: [The Frontier Hotel and Casino](/posts/the-frontier-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/). But its story is far more complex than just a single name. The location itself has worn many hats, starting as Pair O’ Dice in 1931 and cycling through Hotel Last Frontier and New Frontier before finally settling on its most recognizable moniker in 1967.

The original New Frontier experienced financial difficulties that led to its closure in 1964, paving the way for a substantial overhaul. Enter Frontier Properties, backed by significant, and at times controversial, investors including individuals with ties to organized crime. The ambition was grand: a much larger resort, overseen by Jay Friedman and with partial financing from those shadowy sources. The reborn Frontier opened in 1967, boasting 650 rooms and a distinctive 'F' logo, a design crafted by the legendary Bill Clark – a hallmark of vintage Vegas signage.

## Howard Hughes and the Longest Strike in US History

The Frontier’s early years were marked by scrutiny from the Nevada Gaming Control Board, raising concerns about its investors. This ultimately led to Howard Hughes’s acquisition of the property later in 1967, a significant event in Vegas history. Following Hughes's death, the Frontier underwent renovations in the late 70s and later fell into the hands of Margaret Elardi, who targeted a more budget-conscious clientele. This meant a stripping back of amenities compared to the emerging trend of luxury resorts.

However, the Frontier’s most defining moment arrived in 1997, entangled in a bitter labor dispute. The Frontier found itself embroiled in the longest strike in U.S. history, a grueling 2,325-day ordeal. Phil Ruffin’s eventual purchase for $167 million hinged on resolving the strike, resulting in a landmark agreement that saw striking workers return to their jobs and receive substantial back pay. The settlement was a celebration for the community – a testament to the resilience of Vegas’s workforce.

## From Demolition to Future Plans

The Frontier’s physical presence ultimately ended in 2007 when it was demolished. While the name has since been briefly resurrected, it’s now a memory, a tangible link to the rough-and-tumble days of early Las Vegas. The land, purchased by Wynn Resorts in 2018, initially held plans for Wynn West, a direct competitor across from the Wynn and Encore resorts. Those plans were shelved following a change in leadership at Wynn Resorts, leaving the prime Strip location in a state of suspended animation. As of 2024, permits have been extended, offering a glimmer of hope for new development— a fresh chapter for a space steeped in a truly unique and captivating Las Vegas history.
