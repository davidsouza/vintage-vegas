[The Frontier Hotel and Casino](/posts/the-frontier-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/). Just the name evokes images of cowboys, country music, and a distinctly different era of the Las Vegas Strip. While it's long gone, swallowed by the relentless march of progress, its legacy remains etched into the fabric of Las Vegas history. This wasn’t a one-off story; the location itself has cycled through multiple identities – Pair O’ Dice, Hotel Last Frontier, New Frontier, back to Frontier, then New Frontier again – showcasing the Strip’s constant reinvention. Let's journey back to its most iconic iteration, The Frontier (1967-1998).

## A Bold New Frontier

The mid-1960s saw Las Vegas rapidly evolving, striving to shed its slightly shady reputation and embrace a more polished image. The 1967 reopening of The Frontier, after a period of closure and redevelopment, was part of that transformation. Financed in part by connections with organized crime – a reality of Vegas’s early days – and overseen by architect Friedman, the new Frontier was a sprawling complex with 650 rooms, a vibrant entertainment scene, and a memorable 'F' logo designed by Bill Clark. The scale was ambitious, intending to compete with the growing glitz and glamour of the neighboring casinos. Early investors included a young, hungry Steve Wynn, foreshadowing his later dominance of the Strip.

## Entertainment & Identity

The Frontier established a distinct identity. It leaned heavily into a Western theme – a nod to Nevada’s heritage – and became a prime destination for country music lovers and those seeking a less pretentious casino experience. Acts like Tammy Wynette, Loretta Lynn, and Johnny Cash graced its stages, adding to its unique charm. The outdoor space was expansive, a rare commodity on the increasingly dense Strip. It was a place where you could feel a little bit of the Old West colliding with the modern excitement of Vegas.

## A Contentious Exit & a Record-Breaking Strike

However, The Frontier's later years were marked by turbulence. The 1980s and 90s saw declining fortunes, a change in ownership with Margaret Elardi, and a shift towards attracting a budget-conscious clientele. The final chapter, and perhaps the most infamous, involved a bitter and protracted labor dispute. In 1997, Phil Ruffin purchased the Frontier, but only after agreeing to a groundbreaking union contract to resolve a strike that had lasted an astounding 2,325 days – one of the longest in U.S. history! The resolution, celebrated by thousands, was a watershed moment, showcasing the power of organized labor in Las Vegas.

## From Demolition to Potential Rebirth

The Frontier officially closed its doors in 1998, and was briefly rebranded as New Frontier before demolition in 2007. The land, a prime location on the Strip, eventually found its way into the hands of Wynn Resorts. Plans for "Wynn West," a massive new casino resort, were initially unveiled, promising to significantly expand Wynn's footprint.  While those ambitious plans were ultimately paused, the recent permit extensions indicate that a new project, with a hotel tower and expanded casino space, is back on the table.

The Frontier may be gone, but its story serves as a powerful reminder of the Strip’s complex and often tumultuous evolution – a place where dreams were built, fortunes were made (and lost), and the spirit of the Wild West forever intertwined with the dazzling lights of Las Vegas.
