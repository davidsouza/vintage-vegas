## A Tropical Dream on Tropicana: The Polynesian's Brief Reign

The 1980s and early 90s in Las Vegas were a period of intense experimentation. The Strip was exploding with mega-resorts, but smaller properties on the periphery, like those along Tropicana Avenue, fought to find their niche. Enter the Polynesian Hotel and Casino, a bold attempt to transport visitors to a South Pacific paradise, albeit on a modest scale. Opened in 1985, it occupied the spot at 115 East Tropicana, a location previously home to a Howard Johnson’s Motor Lodge.

## A History of Rebranding & Reinvention

The Polynesian’s story is, in itself, a testament to the volatile nature of Las Vegas hospitality. The property didn't spring into existence as the Polynesian. Before that, it cycled through several identities: Paradise, 20th Century, Treasury, and Pacifica. Each one tried a different approach, hoping to capture a segment of the tourist market, but ultimately failing to achieve lasting success. The Polynesian represented another iteration in this revolving door of branding.

## Polynesian Vibes: More Than Just a Theme

What set the Polynesian apart, even briefly, was its commitment to the theme. Think tiki torches, lush tropical landscaping, and Polynesian-inspired decor attempting to evoke a sense of island tranquility. The goal wasn’t to replicate a lavish resort experience; it was to offer a themed ambiance at a more budget-friendly price point, catering to convention-goers and those seeking an alternative to the glitz of the main Strip. It was a promise of escape – a momentary respite from the desert landscape and the hustle of Vegas.

## The Rise and Fall – and the Constant Change

Despite its imaginative concept, the Polynesian struggled financially. The core issue stemmed from the property’s long-standing instability. The location just couldn’t seem to find its footing. In 1989, the Polynesian faded into memory, morphing into the Hotel San Remo. The transition reflects a common pattern in Vegas: adapting to survive. The Hotel San Remo’s strategy shifted again, seeking new audiences. Later iterations included the infamous Hooters Casino Hotel, and finally, the current OYO Hotel & Casino. 

## A Legacy of Transformation

The Polynesian Hotel and Casino's brief existence serves as a fascinating reminder of Las Vegas's relentless pursuit of innovation and reinvention. It exemplifies an era where themed marketing held immense promise. While the Polynesian itself is gone, its legacy lives on as a snapshot of a time when a little tropical charm and a lot of hope could briefly transport visitors—and Las Vegas itself—to a different world. It's a vibrant, if fleeting, chapter in the long and evolving story of a property that continues to reinvent itself.
