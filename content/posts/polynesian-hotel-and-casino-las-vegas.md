## A Short, Sweet Escape: Introducing the Polynesian

The Las Vegas Strip has always been about reinvention. What feels permanent today can be a memory tomorrow. A prime example of this restless spirit is the property currently known as the OYO Hotel & Casino, but for a brief, vibrant period in the mid-1980s, it was the Polynesian Hotel & Casino. Located at 115 East Tropicana Avenue, a spot now often overlooked amidst the sprawling mega-resorts, the Polynesian represented a playful attempt to offer a tropical escape without the mega-bucks price tag.

## From Howard Johnson's to Polynesian Dreams

The story of the Polynesian is intrinsically linked to the history of the land itself. Initially a Howard Johnson’s Motor Lodge, the location had a history of changing identities. Before the Polynesian, it cycled through names like Paradise, 20th Century, Treasury, and Pacifica – none quite finding the winning formula. It wasn't until 1985 that the Polynesian theme emerged, hoping to capture the popularity of Polynesian-themed attractions gaining traction across the US.

## What Made the Polynesian Unique?

The Polynesian aimed to transport guests, if only momentarily, to a South Pacific paradise. The décor leaned heavily into tiki aesthetics – think bamboo accents, lush tropical landscaping, and a playful, albeit modest, attempt at replicating island ambiance. It wasn't striving to be a lavish, immersive experience like the original Polynesian Village at Disneyland; instead, it was about offering a themed touchstone amidst the burgeoning Strip landscape. Targeting convention-goers and budget travelers, the Polynesian carved out a niche, offering a slightly more intimate and themed alternative to the giants that were dominating the skyline. The casino itself remained relatively small, but the overall atmosphere was undeniably unique for its time.

## The Brief Reign and the Inevitable Transformation

Despite its initial promise and unique branding, the Polynesian struggled to gain financial stability. The property, regardless of its identity, seemed to be cursed with a lack of long-term success. In 1989, the Polynesian name faded, replaced by the Hotel San Remo, signaling a complete shift in strategy. This change continued throughout the years, with the property eventually becoming the Hooters Casino Hotel and finally evolving into the OYO Hotel & Casino.

## A Legacy of Reinvention

While its time as the Polynesian was fleeting, its brief existence embodies the bold experimentation that characterized Las Vegas in the 1980s and 1990s. The concept, though perhaps not commercially viable on its own, serves as a fascinating snapshot of the era’s themed marketing optimism and the constant pursuit of novelty that defines Las Vegas history. Today, the OYO Hotel & Casino stands as a testament to the city’s ever-changing face, a constant reminder of the Polynesian's brief but memorable chapter in the story of the Las Vegas Strip.
