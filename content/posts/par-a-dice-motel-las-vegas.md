# A Lucky Name on Fremont Street

Before the mega-resorts and high-roller suites, Las Vegas thrived on a charming, accessible roadside vibe. A key part of that early identity was the Par‑A‑Dice Motel, a beloved fixture on Fremont Street from 1953 until its closure in the early 2010s. Located at 2217 Fremont Street, the motel’s name itself was a clever play on words, capitalizing on the city’s burgeoning gambling culture. The dice imagery – prominently featured on its signage – was a simple, yet effective way to attract the countless travelers passing through.

## The Fremont Street Motor Court Era

The Par‑A‑Dice Motel perfectly embodied the spirit of Las Vegas’s early motor court corridor. This wasn’t about opulent luxury; it was about providing clean, convenient lodging for those arriving by car, eager to experience the excitement of the city.  Rooms were practical and offered direct roadside access, catering to a clientele seeking affordability and ease.  The 1950s and 60s were a period of incredible growth for Las Vegas, and motels like the Par‑A‑Dice played a crucial role in accommodating the influx of tourists.  Think classic roadside Americana, friendly service, and a distinctive neon glow – that was the Par-A-Dice in its heyday.

## A Simple Sign, a Lasting Impression

While it lacked the sprawling casinos and elaborate showrooms that would later define the Las Vegas Strip, the Par‑A‑Dice's most enduring feature was undeniably its neon sign. Topped with enormous dice, it became an instantly recognizable symbol of old Las Vegas. Even faded photographs from the 1960s show a vibrant, eye-catching sign that was impossible to miss.  The sign captured the essence of the era: simple, playful, and full of character.

## Preserving the Legacy

The physical structure of the Par‑A‑Dice Motel sadly disappeared, but thankfully, the city recognized the importance of preserving its legacy. In a significant act of preservation, the iconic neon sign was meticulously restored and relocated to Las Vegas Boulevard. This ensured that future generations would still be able to glimpse a piece of Las Vegas’s unique past.  The sign now pops up in various locations, a constant reminder of the colorful and eclectic era that shaped modern Las Vegas – a time when quirky motels and flashing signs were the main attractions.
