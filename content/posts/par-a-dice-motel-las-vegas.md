## A [Lucky](/posts/lucky-casino-las-vegas/) Roll on Fremont Street

The 1950s in Las Vegas were a time of explosive growth. The city was rapidly transforming from a sleepy desert town into a vibrant entertainment hub, and Fremont Street was *the* place to be. Amidst the burgeoning motor court corridor, a clever bit of wordplay and a whole lot of neon landed in 1953: the Par‑A‑Dice Motel. Located at 2217 Fremont Street, the name itself was a stroke of genius, perfectly aligning with the city’s rapidly developing gambling culture. The dice imagery incorporated into the signage was instantly eye-catching to travelers along the still-developing Las Vegas Strip, beckoning them to stop and stay.

## Simple Comfort, Big Charm

The Par‑A‑Dice Motel wasn’t about glitz and glamour. It epitomized the straightforward, friendly aesthetics that defined the era’s roadside motels. Think practical, easily accessible rooms – catering to families and those seeking a convenient and affordable place to rest their heads after a long journey. There were no sprawling casinos or extravagant showrooms; the appeal lay in its simplicity and the promise of a comfortable night's sleep. Photographs from the 1960s showcase a minimalist façade, a stark contrast to the increasingly opulent resorts that would later define the Strip. It was a time when convenience and a welcoming atmosphere were paramount.

## A Neon Icon Endures

While the motel itself ultimately closed its doors in the early 2010s, its legacy lives on, largely thanks to its iconic neon sign. That towering display of giant dice became synonymous with old Las Vegas, a nostalgic beacon for those who remembered a different era. The sign wasn't just advertising; it *was* a symbol of the city’s quirky, playful spirit. The sight of those illuminated dice evoked a sense of simpler times and the charm of early Las Vegas.

## Preserving the Memory – A Sign's New Home

Recognizing its historical significance, the city undertook a remarkable preservation effort.  The Par‑A‑Dice sign was carefully restored and, in a wonderful tribute to its past, relocated to Las Vegas Boulevard. This ensures that future generations can still catch a glimpse of this beloved relic, a tangible link to the city's foundational years.  It serves as a powerful reminder of the humble beginnings of Las Vegas, a time when motels like the Par‑A‑Dice were the backbone of the city's hospitality landscape.



The Par-A-Dice Motel might be gone, but its sign, popping up at various events and locations, continues to roll the dice on nostalgia, reminding us of the colorful, eclectic past that helped shape the Las Vegas we know today.
