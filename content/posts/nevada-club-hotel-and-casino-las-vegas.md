## From Turf Club to a Strip Staple: The Early Years

Before the mega-resorts and dazzling fountains, the Las Vegas Strip was a collection of smaller, scrappier casinos vying for attention. Among them stood the [Nevada Club](/posts/nevada-club-casino-las-vegas/) Hotel & Casino, a vital piece of that early landscape. Its story began in 1952, not as the Nevada Club, but as the Santa Anita Turf Club. A relatively simple operation initially, it was quickly scooped up and rebranded, laying the groundwork for what would become a significant (and noisy!) landmark.

## The Van Santen Era & The Slot Machine War

The casino’s fortunes truly shifted in 1955 when Robert Van Santen took over. He wasn’t content with simply running a casino; Van Santen wanted to *revolutionize* it. His vision centered around the slots. While other casinos were offering meager payouts, Van Santen introduced generous jackpots, drawing in players and sparking a fierce competition. This was the start of what’s become known as “The Great Las Vegas Slot Machine War.”

But Van Santen didn’t stop at bigger payouts. He understood the psychology of gambling. He introduced sensory enhancements to his machines that are shockingly familiar even today – bells, flashing lights, and, crucially, the iconic payoff tray. Those trays, positioned to allow falling coins to resonate loudly across the casino floor, created a constant soundtrack of winning. The sheer volume of clinking coins served as a powerful draw, an auditory promise of riches that attracted even more players.

## Mergers & Transformations

Van Santen’s ambitious expansion continued. In 1957, the Nevada Club absorbed not only the [Fortune Club](/posts/fortune-club-hotel-and-casino-las-legas/) but also the adjacent Western Union office, consolidating a larger presence on the Strip. The casino was becoming a force to be reckoned with. A further transformation came in 1962 when it was rebranded as Diamond Jim’s Nevada Club, accompanied by a massive, 75-foot marquee that instantly made it a more prominent fixture on the skyline.

## A Legacy of Innovation & Demise

Though Diamond Jim’s Nevada Club was a vibrant part of the Las Vegas scene for nearly two decades, its reign ended abruptly in 1969 when it was purchased by the Golden Nugget. The casino itself vanished, but its legacy lives on. Robert Van Santen's innovations in slot machine design – the generous jackpots, the sensory elements, the resonant payoff trays – fundamentally shaped the modern slot machine experience. Today, the property that once housed the Nevada Club is integrated into the Golden Nugget complex, a quiet reminder of a bygone era when Las Vegas was a little smaller, a little rougher, and a lot louder.
