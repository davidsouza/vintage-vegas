## From Turf Club to Vegas Icon

The Nevada Club Hotel and Casino – a name that conjures images of classic Las Vegas glamour and a surprisingly fierce rivalry. Its history is a microcosm of the city's rapid evolution in the 1950s and 60s, shifting from a modest spot to a significant player, and ultimately, a casualty of progress. The story begins in 1952, when the Nevada Club acquired the Santa Anita Turf Club, a fitting start considering the original structure's focus. It quickly became part of the bustling, nascent Las Vegas Strip, situated in a prime location.

## The Van Santen Era & A Revolutionary Approach to Slots

Things really took off in 1955 when Robert Van Santen purchased the Nevada Club. Van Santen wasn’t content with simply offering games; he envisioned a *show*.  He recognized the burgeoning appeal of slot machines and decided to shake up the industry. This marked the beginning of what would become known as "The Great Las Vegas Slot Machine War."

Van Santen’s innovations were groundbreaking. He started by offering significantly higher jackpots than his competitors. More importantly, he understood the power of sensory stimulation. He introduced features we now consider standard – bells that rang when a win occurred, and even revolving light beacons that flashed across the casino floor when a jackpot hit. The hollow payoff trays beneath each machine amplified the sound of cascading coins, a deliberate tactic to attract attention and create an atmosphere of excitement. This wasn't just about winning; it was about the *performance* of winning, and it drew crowds like never before.

## A Merger & a New Identity

1957 brought another significant change.  The Nevada Club merged with the nearby Fortune Club, and, later that same year, incorporated the Western Union office into the complex. The combined entity retained the Nevada Club name, symbolizing a growing power on the Strip.  In 1962, the property received a visual upgrade with the installation of a massive, 75-foot marquee, further solidifying its presence. The name was temporarily altered to Diamond Jim’s Nevada Club, though that change proved short-lived.

## The End of an Era & A Golden Legacy

Despite its innovations and popularity, the Nevada Club’s time was limited. In 1969, the property was bought out by the Golden Nugget, marking the end of an era for this unique Vegas institution.  While the Nevada Club itself is gone, its legacy lives on. Robert Van Santen's influence on the slot machine industry is undeniable; his sensory enhancements and focus on spectacle are directly responsible for the design and appeal of modern slot machines. Today, the land once occupied by the Nevada Club is part of the Golden Nugget complex, a testament to its past prominence and a reminder of the creative, competitive spirit that defined vintage Las Vegas.
