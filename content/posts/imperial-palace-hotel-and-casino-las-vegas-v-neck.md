## A Chinese Palace Arrives on the Strip

The [Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino](/posts/imperial-palace-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), once a prominent fixture on the Las Vegas Strip, holds a special place in the history of the city's themed resorts. Its story begins in the early 1970s when entrepreneur Ralph Engelstad purchased the [Flamingo Capri](/posts/flamingo-capri-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) motel. Engelstad envisioned something grand, something that would stand out amidst the emerging Vegas landscape. On November 1, 1979, his vision materialized: The Imperial Palace.

The name itself was carefully chosen to evoke the majesty of ancient Chinese palaces. Architect Merlin J. Barth was tasked with bringing this vision to life, and the result was stunning. The hotel's signature feature, and a source of much visual interest, was its distinctive "V Neck" – the dramatic, pagoda-roofed entrance, imported directly from Japan and adorned with vibrant blue tiles. This architectural detail instantly made the Imperial Palace recognizable and became a visual shorthand for the entire property. The rest of the aesthetic followed suit, complete with intricately carved dragon sculptures and shimmering wind-chime chandeliers, creating a truly immersive experience.

## From Motel to Mega-Resort & "Legends in Concert"

What began as a modest motel and small casino quickly blossomed into a sprawling complex throughout the 1980s. Engelstad's ambition knew no bounds. The addition of the Auto Collections showroom in 1981, housing a staggering collection of 250 classic cars worth over $100 million, was a major draw. Guests could marvel at rare and valuable vehicles while enjoying a lavish Vegas experience. The complex continued to grow, adding four hotel towers, a vast shopping arcade dubbed “The Court of a Thousand Treasures,” an Olympic-size pool with a cascading waterfall, and various other amenities.

Entertainment was a core component of the Imperial Palace’s success. But perhaps its most enduring legacy came in the form of "Legends in Concert," launched in May 1983. Featuring talented impersonators of iconic performers like Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and Cher, it became the longest-running show in Las Vegas history – a testament to its enduring appeal and the Imperial Palace's commitment to entertainment.

## A Shadowed Legacy and Transformation

While the Imperial Palace offered a family-friendly atmosphere and affordable rates, its legacy was complicated by Engelstad's controversial personal collections, including Nazi memorabilia, which drew significant criticism. Following Engelstad's death in 2002, the property was acquired by Caesars Entertainment in 2005. Facing changing times and competition on the Strip, a major rebranding was initiated.

In 2012, the Imperial Palace shed its Chinese-inspired identity and was reborn as The Quad Resort & Casino, followed by a further transformation into The LINQ in 2014. While the name and aesthetic have evolved, the site retains a portion of its former grandeur and now plays a vital role within the vibrant LINQ Promenade, anchored by the iconic High Roller Ferris wheel. Although the "V Neck" entrance is gone, memories of the Imperial Palace – its unique design, the thrill of the Auto Collections, and the magic of "Legends in Concert" – remain a cherished part of vintage Las Vegas history.
