## A Hollywood Icon Tries Her Hand at Vegas

The 1990s Las Vegas Strip was a landscape of ambitious expansion and ever-more-extravagant themes. Amidst this frenzy, in 1992, actress Debbie Reynolds, a true Hollywood legend, made a bold move: she and her then-husband, Richard Hamlett, purchased the Paddlewheel Hotel and Casino for $2.2 million. The plan? To transform it into a dazzling tribute to Hollywood’s golden age, complete with a museum showcasing Reynolds’ incredible collection of movie memorabilia. It was a dream project, a chance to blend her two worlds.

## The Debbie Reynolds Hollywood Hotel & Casino: A Sparkle and a Trademark Dispute

Rebranded as the Debbie Reynolds Hollywood Hotel and Casino, the property officially opened in July 1993. The vision was grand: a 1,200-room hotel with a focus on entertainment and, of course, Reynolds’ museum. The hotel itself was designed to evoke classic Hollywood glamour, and Reynolds herself regularly performed in a custom-built theater designed by her son, Todd Fisher.  The casino, operated by Jackpot Enterprises, was initially modest with just 184 slot machines and two table games. However, the name proved problematic. A trademark dispute quickly arose, forcing the “Hollywood” designation to be dropped late in 1993 – leaving us with the slightly less evocative Debbie Reynolds Hotel & Casino.

## Financial Turbulence and a Public Offering

Unfortunately, Reynolds and Hamlett were ill-equipped for the complexities of running a Las Vegas resort. Amenities were largely leased out, while they concentrated on entertainment and the museum. The financial realities soon proved harsh. The hotel struggled, leading to a public offering in 1994 to raise capital.  To further bolster finances, the top floors were sold as timeshares, a common practice at the time. Todd Fisher later pointed to undercapitalization and mismanagement as key contributors to the hotel’s difficulties. By 1995, Fisher took over managing the business.

## A Quick Decline and a Neon Legacy

The situation continued to deteriorate, culminating in the casino’s closure in March 1996 after Jackpot Enterprises’ contract was terminated. Reynolds' attempts to secure a gaming license were unsuccessful due to the hotel's precarious financial state. In July 1997, both Reynolds and the hotel filed for bankruptcy, a devastating blow to the ambitious project.  David Siegel of Westgate Resorts invested to keep the property afloat, and a minimal casino with only 25 slot machines reopened briefly to maintain gaming status.

The property went to auction in August 1999, marking a truly emotional end for Debbie Reynolds. Thankfully, the iconic neon sign, a vibrant symbol of the hotel’s brief but memorable run, was rescued and now shines brightly within the Las Vegas Neon Museum, ensuring its legacy lives on. Today, the site is poised for a new chapter, with plans for a high-rise, non-gaming hotel, Majestic Las Vegas, set to break ground in 2024.
