The 1990s were a period of immense change and, sometimes, ambitious overreach on the Las Vegas Strip. Among the glittering lights and burgeoning mega-resorts, a unique venture emerged: the Debbie Reynolds Hotel & Casino. In 1992, Hollywood legend Debbie Reynolds, alongside her then-husband Richard Hamlett, purchased the struggling Paddlewheel Hotel and Casino for a cool $2.2 million, envisioning a glittering destination blending entertainment, a touch of old Hollywood glamour, and a showcase for her extensive and priceless collection of movie memorabilia.

## A Hollywood Dream on the Strip

The revamped hotel, debuting as the Debbie Reynolds Hollywood Hotel & Casino in July 1993, was intended to be something special. Reynolds was deeply involved, wanting to bring an authentic slice of Hollywood history to the Vegas landscape. Plans included a significant $15 million renovation and, most notably, a dedicated museum highlighting her vast collection of costumes, props, and other Hollywood treasures. The theater, designed by her son Todd Fisher, was intended to be a centerpiece, featuring Reynolds herself in a series of performances. While Jackpot Enterprises managed the 184-slot-machine and two-table-game casino, Reynolds focused on the entertainment and museum elements. The removal of “Hollywood” from the name by the end of 1993 followed a trademark dispute, simplifying the branding.

## Facing Financial Storms

Unfortunately, the dream quickly ran into turbulent waters. Reynolds and Hamlett, while brimming with enthusiasm, lacked significant experience in resort operations. Consequently, many amenities were leased out, rather than directly managed, which further complicated things. From the outset, the casino struggled financially, compounded by what Todd Fisher later attributed to undercapitalization and mismanagement. The resort went public in 1994 in a desperate attempt to inject much-needed capital. To further bolster the revenue stream, the top floors were sold as timeshares – a common practice at the time but a sign of financial stress.

## A Brief Resurgence & Final Chapter

The situation escalated to the point where Fisher took control of the business in 1995.  The casino closed in March 1996 after the contract with Jackpot Enterprises was terminated. Reynolds' inability to secure a gaming license underscored the severity of the financial situation.  A symbolic reopening occurred in September 1997, sustaining just 25 slot machines to maintain gaming status during bankruptcy proceedings.  David Siegel of Westgate Resorts, recognizing some potential, invested $200,000 to help keep the lights on, but ultimately, a bankruptcy auction was unavoidable. August 1999 marked the bittersweet end, a deeply emotional moment for Reynolds.

## Legacy and Remembrance

While short-lived, the Debbie Reynolds Hotel & Casino left a unique mark on Las Vegas history. The iconic neon sign, a vibrant symbol of the venture, was thankfully preserved at the Neon Museum, ensuring its memory remains. The land, now owned by Lorenzo Doumani, is poised for a new chapter with the proposed Majestic Las Vegas high-rise – a non-gaming hotel planned for groundbreaking in 2024 and a projected opening in 2027. The story of the Debbie Reynolds Hotel stands as a poignant reminder that even stars can face hard realities in the unpredictable world of Vegas casinos.
