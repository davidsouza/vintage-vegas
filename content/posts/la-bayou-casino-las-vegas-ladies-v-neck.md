## A Century of Gaming on Fremont Street

The story of La Bayou Casino isn't just about one casino; it's about a landmark site on Fremont Street, steeped in Las Vegas history. The location at 15 East Fremont Street boasts an incredible lineage, starting all the way back in 1913 as the Las Vegas Coffee House. It then evolved into the Northern Club in 1920, a significant moment because it secured the first-ever gaming license in Las Vegas, held by the pioneering Mayme Stocker. From there, it cycled through iterations like the Turf Club, Monte Carlo Club, and the beloved Coin Castle – a visual spectacle with playful coin-themed décor now largely preserved at the Neon Museum. Each name represented a shift in the evolving landscape of Las Vegas gambling.

## La Bayou: A New Orleans Celebration

The 1999 rebirth as La Bayou, spearheaded by Herb Pastor, was a true stroke of genius. Recognizing the need for a lighter, more approachable gambling experience, Pastor invested $6 million to transform Coin Castle into a vibrant, New Orleans-themed casino. The exterior was a riot of Mardi Gras colors, a stark contrast to the increasingly modern and sophisticated casinos on the Strip. Inside, a daiquiri bar offered a dizzying array of 26 flavors, and instead of the ubiquitous paper vouchers, slot machines dispensed actual coins—a nostalgic touch that resonated with many. La Bayou was deliberately aiming for a playful atmosphere and appealing to a broad demographic.

## The Ladies and the V-Neck Uniforms

What truly set La Bayou apart, beyond its unique theme, was the dedication to a personalized, energetic guest experience. A key part of this was the friendly, engaging team of women who worked there. These ladies weren't just dealers; they were ambassadors of fun, handing out beads, encouraging spontaneous mini-games, and conducting popular half-hour contest wheel drawings for substantial prizes - $10,000 was a common top prize!  And their uniform? A distinctive, cheerful V-neck top and pants combination, emblematic of the casino's welcoming vibe.  These women embodied the La Bayou spirit, and many became beloved fixtures in the Fremont Street Experience. They created a level of casual, engaging interaction that was rare as Vegas increasingly became high-end.

## A Farewell & Lasting Legacy

The La Bayou era sadly came to a close in April 2016 when Derek and Greg Stevens, owners of Golden Gate, The D, and Las Vegas Club, acquired the property.  On June 27, 2016, its doors permanently closed, marking the end of an era. While the site was quickly absorbed into an expanded Golden Gate casino, La Bayou’s legacy continues. It remains a treasured memory for those who appreciate classic, coin-based gaming and a more relaxed, friendly atmosphere. La Bayou served as a vital piece of Fremont Street's history, a reminder of a time when Las Vegas embraced playful charm and a genuine sense of community. The memory of those ladies in their V-neck uniforms continues to evoke a simpler, more fun-loving era of Las Vegas.
