## From Deli to Brewpub: A Shifting Legacy on Sahara & The Strip

For those who remember a Las Vegas that wasn’t all mega-resorts and choreographed fountain shows, the Holy Cow! Casino Cafe Brewery held a special place in local hearts. Located at the bustling northeast corner of Sahara Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard, this wasn’t your typical Strip destination. It was a quirky, beloved institution born from a long and fascinating history, a testament to Las Vegas’s ever-evolving spirit.

Its story began in 1955 as Foxy’s Deli, a groundbreaking establishment recognized as the first integrated restaurant on the Strip. Back then, it was a hangout for some of the biggest names in entertainment: Liberace, Wayne Newton, and Shecky Greene were regular patrons. Imagine the conversations and the energy! The deli's legacy continued in 1976 as Foxy’s Firehouse Casino, which operated until 1988, maintaining a familiar presence for locals.

## The Birth of a Brewpub Pioneer

Fast forward to 1992 when Tom “Big Dog” Wiesner acquired the property and reimagined it as Holy Cow!, a casino and cafe. But Wiesner’s most significant contribution came in 1993. Recognizing the potential for a unique and local flavor in the Vegas beverage scene, he fought for, and ultimately won, the right to open Las Vegas's first brewpub, changing Nevada law in the process. This was a monumental shift, paving the way for the craft beer movement we see today.

## Alphie and the Award-Winning Brews

No discussion of Holy Cow! is complete without mentioning Alphie, the 14-foot fiberglass Holstein cow sporting cool sunglasses. This playful mascot became an instant icon, symbolizing the establishment's lighthearted and approachable nature. The brewery itself quickly gained a reputation for quality, winning a gold medal in 1993 for its English pale ale, followed by bronze awards for its red ale and stout. Over the late 90s, they brewed an impressive 800+ batches, regularly participating in beer festivals and drawing a loyal following.

## A Relaxed Oasis and a Lasting Memory

The atmosphere at Holy Cow! was distinctly different from the glitz and glamour of the Strip. It was cozy, relaxed, and a genuine community gathering spot, where the comforting jingle of slot machines blended perfectly with the aroma of freshly brewed beer. Even beloved Cubs announcer Harry Caray made a pilgrimage, leaving his mark with an autographed “Holy cow!” under his signature call.

Sadly, the Holy Cow!'s run ended abruptly on March 22, 2002, following the devastating impact of the September 11th attacks on tourism. While the brewery operations eventually relocated, the building itself was demolished in 2012 and is now a Walgreens. Though the physical location is gone, the spirit lives on, embodied by Alphie, who now graces the grounds of the Longstreet Inn & Casino in Amargosa Valley. Holy Cow! remains a vibrant chapter in vintage Las Vegas history – a reminder of a time when local charm and innovative ideas could thrive on the Strip.
