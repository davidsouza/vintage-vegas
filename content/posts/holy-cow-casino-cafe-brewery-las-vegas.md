## From Foxy’s Deli to Holy Cow!: A Multi-Stage Evolution

The northeast corner of [Sahara](/posts/sahara-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard has seen a lot of changes over the years, but few establishments were as uniquely memorable as the Holy Cow! Casino Cafe Brewery. Its history isn’t a simple one; it’s a layered story of adaptation and innovation stretching back to 1955. Originally, the spot was “Foxy’s Deli,” a groundbreaking establishment lauded as the Strip’s first integrated restaurant. That meant it welcomed both locals and tourists, a somewhat revolutionary concept back then.  The celebrity clientele – including legends like Liberace, Wayne Newton, and Shecky Greene – only added to its allure and solidified its place in early Las Vegas lore.

## A Casino and a Brewpub Pioneer

The deli’s evolution continued through iterations like Foxy’s Firehouse Casino, operating until 1988. Then, in 1992, Tom “Big Dog” Wiesner purchased the property and breathed new life into it as Holy Cow! Casino Cafe. Wiesner had a vision – to create a relaxed, neighborhood-style casino and eatery that was a welcome respite from the glitz and glamour of the Strip. And that’s precisely what he achieved.

But it was Wiesner's 1993 move that truly cemented Holy Cow!'s legacy: convincing Nevada lawmakers to allow breweries within Las Vegas city limits. This landmark decision paved the way for Nevada's first brewpub, instantly making Holy Cow! a pioneer in the burgeoning craft beer scene.  The brewery quickly gained respect, earning awards, including a gold medal for its English Pale Ale – a significant achievement for a fledgling operation.  Over the years, they brewed over 800 batches and regularly participated in beer festivals, demonstrating a dedication to quality and innovation.

## Alphie and the Atmosphere

No discussion of Holy Cow! is complete without mentioning Alphie, the 14-foot fiberglass Holstein cow sporting sunglasses. This whimsical mascot became instantly recognizable, a beacon of fun and good times.  Inside, the atmosphere was distinctively casual. The clatter of slot machines mingled with the aroma of freshly brewed beer, creating a genuinely unique and welcoming ambiance. The spot even earned a visit from beloved Cubs announcer Harry Caray, who left his mark with a signed wall inscription – naturally incorporating his signature "Holy Cow!" exclamation.



## A Loss and a Legacy

Sadly, the September 11th attacks delivered a significant blow to Las Vegas tourism, ultimately leading to Holy Cow!'s closure on March 22, 2002. While the brewery operations continued elsewhere, the beloved establishment faded into memory. The building itself was demolished in 2012, replaced by a Walgreens—a stark contrast to the quirky charm that once defined the corner. Yet, Alphie lives on, finding a new home outside the Longstreet Inn & Casino in Amargosa Valley, serving as a tangible reminder of Holy Cow!'s unique place in Las Vegas history. It was a true slice of the city's evolving personality, a place where gaming, dining, and brewing innovation came together in a way that no other establishment has replicated.
