## From Foxy’s Deli to Holy Cow!: A Tale of Transformation

Before it became the quirky, beer-loving haven we remember, the northeast corner of Sahara and the Strip had a different identity. Originally debuting in 1955 as Foxy’s Deli, it held the distinction of being the Strip’s first integrated restaurant – a groundbreaking concept for the era. Imagine Liberace, Wayne Newton, and Shecky Greene enjoying a casual meal! Foxy’s morphed into Foxy’s Firehouse Casino, continuing operation until 1988. Then, in 1992, Tom “Big Dog” Wiesner purchased the property, revitalizing it with the wonderfully whimsical concept of Holy Cow! Casino Cafe Brewery.

## Brewing History in Sin City

What truly set Holy Cow! apart was Wiesner’s determination. He successfully lobbied Nevada lawmakers, a feat achieved in 1993, to allow breweries within Las Vegas city limits. This pivotal moment birthed the first legal brewpub in the state. Suddenly, the jingle of slot machines was intertwined with the aroma of freshly brewed beer – a distinctly local and refreshing change from the increasingly opulent Strip.

The brewery itself quickly gained recognition. Their English pale ale earned a gold medal in 1993, a testament to Wiesner's vision and the team's brewing skill. Success followed with bronze medals for their red ale and stout, leading to over 800 batches brewed and a frequent presence at beer festivals. Those who visited recall a cozy, relaxed atmosphere, a welcome respite from the high-roller scene.

## Alphie and a Lasting Legacy

No discussion of Holy Cow! is complete without mentioning Alphie, the 14-foot fiberglass Holstein cow sporting sunglasses. This instantly recognizable mascot embodied the playful spirit of the establishment and became an iconic symbol of its unique charm. A visit from Cubs announcer Harry Caray, who left his signature “Holy cow!” scrawled on a wall, only cemented Holy Cow!'s place in Las Vegas lore. 

Sadly, the events of 9/11 significantly impacted tourism, leading to the closure of Holy Cow! on March 22, 2002. While the brewery operations moved on, the spirit of the place lived on. The building itself was eventually demolished in 2012, replaced by a Walgreens, but Alphie, the beloved cow, found a new home at the Longstreet Inn & Casino in Amargosa Valley, ensuring that the memory of Holy Cow Casino Cafe Brewery – a true pioneer of Las Vegas’ unique brewpub scene – isn't forgotten.
