## A Slice of Unpretentious Vegas

For decades, just off the glitz and glamour of the Las Vegas Strip, sat Davy’s Locker Bar and Casino. Opened in 1968 at the corner of Desert Inn Road and Maryland Parkway, it wasn't aiming for high rollers or celebrity clientele. Davy’s Locker catered to a different kind of visitor—and, importantly, a loyal base of local regulars. It was the quintessential “dive bar,” a haven from the Strip's increasingly polished image, and a place where a cheap beer and a friendly face were always on offer.

## The Alluring Glow of "Davy"

What truly set Davy’s Locker apart was its neon sign. A whimsical, cartoonish fish—affectionately nicknamed “Davy”—radiated a playful glow that became instantly recognizable. This wasn't the sophisticated, architecturally impressive neon of the grand casino-hotels. “Davy” was pure, unfiltered Vegas character. It symbolized the bar's down-to-earth atmosphere and became a magnet for those seeking a less-formal experience. The light from Davy’s fish was a beacon in the desert night, a promise of affordable drinks and a welcoming atmosphere.

## The Inside Story: A Community Hub

Stepping inside Davy’s Locker was like stepping back in time. The decor was modest: a worn Internet jukebox, a pool table, a handful of TVs perpetually tuned to sporting events, and a modest selection of slot machines and video poker terminals. It lacked the extravagance of the Strip’s casinos, but the charm lay in its simplicity and authenticity. The bartenders weren’t seasoned cocktail servers; they were friendly, no-frills purveyors of ice-cold beer, often Miller High Life going for a ridiculously low $1.50.  This fostered a genuine sense of community. Tourists and locals alike mingled, creating a vibe that felt rare for a city renowned for its transient nature. You could strike up a conversation with anyone – a visiting gambler, a construction worker, or a retired showgirl.

## A Fading Light and Enduring Legacy

Sadly, Davy's Locker’s story didn't have a happy ending. Despite the efforts of preservationists to revive the iconic neon sign in 2011 (a brief, joyous return after years of darkness), ongoing maintenance challenges eventually proved too much.  The bar closed its doors, and under new ownership in 2016, the original sign was dismantled.  However, the legacy of Davy’s Locker didn’t disappear entirely. Recognizing the sign's significance, its panels were rescued and reimagined, finding a new life within Nevada Taste Site in the Arts District.  While the physical bar is gone, Davy’s fish continues to swim on, a vibrant reminder of a simpler, more unpretentious era of Las Vegas. Today, the spot is occupied by Bert’s Gaming, a stark contrast to the warm, inviting atmosphere that once defined Davy’s Locker.
