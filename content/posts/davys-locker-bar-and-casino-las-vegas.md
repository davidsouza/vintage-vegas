## A Slice of Vegas Dive Life: Davys Locker Bar and Casino

For those who knew it, Davys Locker was more than just a bar; it was a refuge. Tucked away at the corner of Desert Inn Road and Maryland Parkway, just a stone's throw from the dazzling lights of the Las Vegas Strip, Davys Locker opened its doors in 1968. It wasn't one of the glittering casinos vying for high-roller attention, but a humble dive bar, a place where regulars and tourists could mingle over cheap drinks and a friendly game.

## The Legend of Davy: A Neon Icon

What truly set Davys Locker apart was its iconic neon sign – a whimsical, brightly-colored fish affectionately nicknamed “Davy.” This wasn't some sophisticated, high-design piece. It was charmingly quirky, a beacon of old-school Vegas character that pulsed with a playful glow. For decades, Davy welcomed patrons, becoming as synonymous with the bar as its well-worn pool table. The sign’s eventual darkness in the early 2000s marked a noticeable dimming of a Vegas institution. Thankfully, a dedicated group of preservationists rallied to restore Davy’s neon in 2011, a testament to its importance in the city’s visual history.

## A True Dive Bar Experience

Stepping inside Davys Locker felt like stepping back in time. The atmosphere was unapologetically 'divey': an Internet jukebox blasting classic tunes, a handful of TV screens displaying whatever sports were on, a worn pool table offering a casual challenge, and a smattering of video poker and slot machines. The bartenders, many of whom were long-term fixtures, knew their regulars by name and poured generous drinks – Miller High Life for a mere $1.50! It was this down-to-earth atmosphere, the lack of pretension, that made Davys Locker so beloved. It fostered a genuine community vibe rarely found within the often-sterile environment of the Strip’s mega-casinos.

## The End of an Era, but Not the End of the Story

Sadly, Davys Locker closed its doors. New ownership took over in 2016, and soon after, the original neon sign was dismantled. While the bar itself is gone, Davy’s legacy lives on. Recognizing the sign’s historical significance, preservationists rescued its panels, ensuring they wouldn’t be lost to time. Today, these panels have found a new home within Nevada Taste Site in the Arts District, a vibrant reminder of a simpler, more authentic Las Vegas. The property itself now houses Bert’s Gaming. While Davy may no longer swim on the corner of Desert Inn and Maryland, the memory of Davys Locker Bar and Casino, and its iconic neon fish, remains a cherished piece of vintage Las Vegas history.
