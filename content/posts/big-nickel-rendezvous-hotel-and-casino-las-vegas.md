## A Nickel's Worth of Dreams: The [Rendezvous](/posts/rendezvous-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) and Big Nickel Story

Downtown Las Vegas has always been a landscape of constant change. While the iconic casinos of Fremont Street East dominated the scene, smaller ventures often tried to carve out their own niche. The property currently at 400 East Ogden Avenue is a prime example of this – a site that’s lived multiple lives, most notably as the Rendezvous Hotel & Casino and, later, the Big Nickel. It’s a story of ambition, adaptation, and the ever-present struggle for survival in the neon-lit heart of the city.

## From Lodge to Limited Run: The Rendezvous Era (1977-1978)

The history of 400 East Ogden doesn't begin with gambling. Originally the Grace Hayes Lodge, it later morphed into a casual hangout known as “The Patio.” In 1977, a bold transformation occurred: The Patio became the Rendezvous Hotel & Casino. This marked its first foray into the world of regulated gaming, offering a relatively standard selection of slots, blackjack, craps, and keno. To lure in customers, the Rendezvous offered complimentary drink chips - a common tactic in the competitive Vegas market. However, the Rendezvous' run was surprisingly brief, lasting just around nine months. It was a taste of what was to come - a property caught between attempting to find its place in the crowded Downtown scene.

## The Big Nickel: Branding with a Budget (1978-?)

The short-lived Rendezvous vanished, and in late 1978, a new identity emerged: the Big Nickel. This name was instantly memorable, leaning heavily into a theme of value and affordability. The giant nickel out front was undoubtedly eye-catching – a visual promise of budget-friendly gaming. The branding strategy reflected the reality of a mid-scale casino trying to compete with the established giants like Binion's and Golden Nugget. It offered a slightly different experience, appealing to a player base looking for lower table minimums and a more relaxed atmosphere.

## More Than Just a Nickel: A Downtown Echo

While the Big Nickel never achieved the fame of its more glamorous neighbors, it played a significant role in the fabric of Downtown Las Vegas. It represented the relentless innovation, and often precarious survival, of smaller casinos attempting to find their footing. The era of the Rendezvous and Big Nickel showcases the experimentation that defined vintage Las Vegas—a willingness to try new branding and concepts.

## A Legacy Reclaimed

The Big Nickel’s time was eventually cut short, succumbing to market pressures and changing ownership. The site was eventually absorbed into the Gold Spike property, retaining a bit of that playful, slightly offbeat vibe. Though gaming operations ultimately ceased at that location, the memory of the Rendezvous and Big Nickel lingers as a fascinating chapter in Downtown's story - a reminder of the countless ventures that shaped the Las Vegas we know today. It stands as a testament to the constant evolution and ever-changing landscape of the city’s gaming scene.
