## A Nickel's Worth of Vegas History

Downtown Las Vegas has always been a whirlwind of reinvention, and few properties exemplify that spirit more than the address at 400 East Ogden Avenue. Today part of the Gold Spike, this spot has worn many faces over the years, but its time as the Rendezvous Hotel & Casino, and later the iconic Big Nickel, represents a specific and intriguing chapter in vintage Las Vegas history. It’s a story of ambition, quick pivots, and the constant struggle for survival in a crowded market.

## From Grace Hayes to the Rendezvous

Before the nickel, there was the Rendezvous. The site’s history stretches back further than most remember, having previously housed the Grace Hayes Lodge and “The Patio.” In 1977, the owners sought a fresh start, transforming the existing structure into a casino and hotel. The Rendezvous opened with a classic lineup of games: slots, blackjack, craps, and keno, hoping to attract a steady stream of players. To entice those players, complimentary drink chips were a common promotional tactic – a staple of early Vegas marketing. However, the Rendezvous' run was brief, lasting a mere nine months before needing a dramatic change of direction.

## The Big Nickel Takes Center Stage

Late 1978 marked the dawn of a new era, and a wonderfully kitschy one at that. The Rendezvous was reborn as the Big Nickel. The name itself was a calculated move, instantly conjuring a sense of value and affordability. The giant nickel sign, a playful nod to the classic nickel slot machines, was a visual signal to passersby – “friendly, accessible gaming!” It was a branding strategy reflecting a target audience hungry for affordable entertainment.

## Navigating the Fremont Street Landscape

The Big Nickel faced an uphill battle. Fremont Street was, and remains, a fiercely competitive environment. Established casinos like the Golden Nugget and Binion’s Horseshoe commanded a loyal clientele. The Big Nickel’s attempt to carve out a niche as a value-driven destination proved challenging. Ownership changes reflected the constant financial pressures. Despite the difficulties, the Big Nickel left its mark, a quirky and memorable presence in the heart of Downtown.

## Legacy and Transformation

Eventually, the Big Nickel was absorbed into the Gold Spike, continuing a gaming tradition at the location for decades. While the Gold Spike ultimately transitioned away from its casino roots, the memories of the Rendezvous and, especially, the Big Nickel remain. The site now stands as a testament to the dynamism and constant evolution of Downtown Las Vegas. It’s a place where vintage Vegas dreams and modern visions collide, a reminder that even short-lived ventures contribute to the rich tapestry of this incredible city’s history—and that even a nickel can have a big story to tell.
