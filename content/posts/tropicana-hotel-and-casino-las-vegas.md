## A Lush Oasis Arrives on the Strip

The [Tropicana](/posts/tropicana-country-club-las-vegas/) Hotel and Casino, affectionately known as the "Tropicana" or "Trop," was more than just a casino; it was an experience. Opening its doors on April 4, 1957, this 35-acre tropical [paradise](/posts/paradise-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) represented a significant leap in Las Vegas’s burgeoning resort industry. At a staggering cost – the most expensive property on the Strip at the time – the Trop aimed to transport guests to a lush, exotic escape. Imagine vibrant pink stucco buildings, cascading waterfalls, dense foliage, and wandering flamingos—it was a stark contrast to the then-more conventional Vegas offerings. With 1,467 rooms and a sprawling 44,570 sq ft casino, the Tropicana instantly became a major player.

## Glamour, Mob Ties, and the Folies Bergère

The early years were synonymous with glamour and high-rolling clientele.  The Trop quickly became a playground for celebrities and a favorite among those seeking a luxurious, tropical-themed getaway. But the story isn’t solely one of sparkling lights and showgirls. Like many Vegas institutions of the era, the Tropicana had significant ties to organized crime.  A sophisticated skimming operation, detailed in the FBI’s investigations, operated through the property for a period, adding a darker layer to its history. 

Undoubtedly, the defining feature of the Tropicana was the Folies Bergère, a lavish revue that ran for an incredible 27 years!  It became the longest-running show in Las Vegas history and a major draw for visitors worldwide. The elaborate costumes, dazzling choreography, and high-energy performances embodied the spirit of the Trop – extravagant, playful, and unforgettable.



## Changing Hands and Modern Revivals

Over the decades, the Tropicana experienced a revolving door of ownership. From Aztar Corporation to Columbia Sussex, and later Onex Corporation, each change brought new investment and renovations. The $180 million revamp in 2011 attempted to modernize the property while preserving its unique character, though many felt it strayed from the original charm. Despite these changes, the Trop stubbornly clung to its identity, trying to balance the demands of evolving tastes with the nostalgia for its golden age.

## A Farewell to Paradise

The Trop's 67-year run came to an end on April 2, 2024, just two days before its 68th anniversary.  Its demolition to pave the way for a new baseball stadium and resort – a joint venture between Bally’s and the Oakland Athletics – marked a definitive shift in the Las Vegas landscape. While the loss is keenly felt by many who remember the Trop’s vibrant heyday, its legacy as a pioneering and iconic Las Vegas landmark will endure.  The memories of its flamboyant shows, lush gardens, and a taste of old Vegas glamour will continue to resonate, even as a new era begins on the Strip.
