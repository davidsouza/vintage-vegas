## From Frontier to New Frontier: A Wild West Start

Before the mega-resorts and dazzling lights, the Las Vegas Strip was a rough-and-tumble place. In 1942, Harry Brandeis and Guy McAfee envisioned a Western-themed hotel and casino at the far end of the Strip, then a dusty stretch far from the city’s center. Thus, the Frontier Hotel and Casino was born, embracing a Wild West aesthetic with cowboys, horses, and a distinctly untamed atmosphere. The Frontier quickly became a popular spot, particularly appealing to those seeking a more authentic, less polished Vegas experience. It offered affordable rooms and gambling, catering to a middle-class clientele—a crucial segment that helped fuel the city’s growth.

## A Name Change and a Resurgence

Over the decades, the Frontier evolved. It underwent several ownership changes and renovations, but struggled to keep pace with the increasingly sophisticated competition on the Strip. In 1998, Phil Ruffin purchased the property and, in a nostalgic move, immediately rebranded it as the New Frontier. He recognized its potential and invested $20 million in a significant refresh. New dining options were added, rooms were updated, and the overall vibe was subtly improved, boosting profitability.

## A Bold Plan, Delayed Dreams

Ruffin had grand ambitions. His initial plan included demolishing the New Frontier to make way for “City by the Bay,” a San Francisco-themed casino resort. He even partnered with Donald Trump to build Trump International Hotel Las Vegas on a portion of the land. However, financial roadblocks repeatedly delayed the ambitious project. Ultimately, the New Frontier’s fate took another turn.

## A Record-Breaking Sale and a Farewell

In 2005, Ruffin sold the New Frontier to El Ad Properties for a staggering $1.2 billion – a record-breaking real estate transaction that underscored the Strip’s booming value. El Ad’s vision was to replace it with a $5 billion Plaza-branded resort. Sadly, the New Frontier’s time was nearing an end. The hotel closed its doors in July 2007 without much fanfare, a quiet exit for a once-iconic property. The iconic roadside sign remained a beloved landmark for over a year after the closure.

## Demolition and a Lingering Legacy

The New Frontier was finally imploded in November 2007, following a spectacular fireworks display. The demolition was a symbolic moment, marking the end of an era for vintage Las Vegas. While the building itself is gone, the New Frontier’s legacy lives on in the memories of those who experienced its Wild West charm and its pivotal role in the evolution of the Las Vegas Strip. Today, the site remains vacant, awaiting a new chapter—one that hopefully acknowledges and respects the spirit of the Frontier that once stood there. The possibility of a Wynn West resort looms, hinting at a future potentially shaped by the echoes of the past.
