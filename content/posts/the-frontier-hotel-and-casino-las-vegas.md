## From Frontier to New Frontier: A Wild West Start

The Frontier Hotel and Casino, originally simply "Frontier Hotel," holds a significant place in the history of the Las Vegas Strip. Opened in 1942 by William "Guy" McAfee and Irv Burton, it was intentionally designed to evoke the feeling of the American West. Unlike the glitz and glamour of downtown, the Frontier aimed for a rustic, adventurous atmosphere, with wooden facades, swinging saloon doors, and a Wild West theme. This was a deliberate choice; it appealed to a broader demographic, particularly families and middle-class tourists, and helped solidify the Strip’s identity as an entertainment destination beyond the more established downtown casinos. The Frontier quickly became a popular destination, boasting 60 rooms and a bustling casino.

## A Middle-Class Appeal & Evolving Times

For decades, the Frontier (later rebranded as the New Frontier in 1967) remained a vital part of the Las Vegas landscape. It served as a key player in the burgeoning resort industry, catering primarily to a middle-class clientele, a demographic often overlooked by the more luxurious, high-roller-focused casinos further down the Strip. However, by the late 1990s, the New Frontier had become dated and struggled to compete with the increasingly opulent resorts surrounding it. Its design felt stuck in the past while its competitors embraced modern luxury.

## Ruffin's Rescue & the Promise of "City by the Bay"

Enter Phil Ruffin in 1998. Recognizing the potential beneath the aging exterior, Ruffin purchased the property and restored the original “New Frontier” name. A $20 million renovation helped revitalize the resort, attracting renewed interest and boosting profitability. He then unveiled ambitious plans for “City by the Bay,” a San Francisco-themed casino resort. This project represented a bold vision for the future of the site, but financial obstacles ultimately derailed its immediate construction.

## A Record-Breaking Sale & a Dramatic Demise

Despite the stalled "City by the Bay" project, the New Frontier’s land value skyrocketed. In 2005, Ruffin sold the property to El Ad Properties for a staggering $1.2 billion – a record-breaking real estate transaction on the Las Vegas Strip. Their vision: a $5 billion Plaza-branded resort. The New Frontier closed its doors in July 2007 without much fanfare, quietly bowing out of the Las Vegas story. The implosion, a spectacle of fireworks followed by a controlled demolition in November 2007, marked a definitive end to an era. The iconic roadside sign lingered for a while longer, a poignant reminder of what once was, but ultimately succumbed to the progress of the Strip.

## Legacy & The Future of the Land

While the New Frontier is gone, its legacy remains. It was a foundational piece of the Las Vegas Strip, defining a distinct era and catering to a broad audience. The land itself has seen several iterations since, including the Trump International Hotel and now, a potential new Wynn resort. Currently vacant, the space stands as a reminder of the ever-evolving nature of Las Vegas, and a testament to the enduring allure of vintage Las Vegas history.
