## A Brief but Bright [Polynesian](/posts/polynesian-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Dream on the Strip

For those of us who cherish vintage Las Vegas, the [Castaways](/posts/castaways-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Hotel & Casino holds a bittersweet place in memory. Standing on the Strip today, it's hard to imagine a resort once occupied that space, but from 1963 to 1987, the Castaways offered a distinct Polynesian flair amidst a rapidly evolving landscape.

The story begins with the [Sans Souci](/posts/sans-souci-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), a struggling property bought by Ben Jaffe, already a prominent figure due to his ownership of the [Tropicana](/posts/tropicana-country-club-las-vegas/). Recognizing potential, Jaffe ambitiously rebranded it as the Castaways, promising a vibrant Polynesian-themed escape. The September 1, 1963, reopening was a genuine attempt to offer something different – tiki torches, lush landscaping, and a casino run by the experienced duo of Ike P. LaRue and Everett Eugene McCarlie. 

## Financial Tides and a Surprise Savior

Unfortunately, the initial vision didn’t translate into long-term financial success. Just over a year later, the casino abruptly closed its doors on December 3, 1964. While the hotel itself continued to operate, the closure signaled difficulties. Then, a true savior appeared: Howard Hughes. In a deal finalized in 1967, Hughes acquired the Castaways for $3.3 million, a sum reflecting the property's precarious position.

## Hughes’s Touch and a Final Curtain

Hughes, always looking to elevate his holdings, made strategic improvements. A larger showroom was added, allowing for bigger acts and more elaborate productions, and casino renovations followed in 1971 and again in 1981, trying to keep the property competitive. These changes represented a period of attempted revitalization, demonstrating the Strip's constant struggle to stay relevant.

Ultimately, however, the Castaways’ fate was sealed. In 1986, Steve Wynn purchased the property for a staggering $50 million, signaling a definitive end to the Castaways era. With 228 rooms and 650 employees, the resort closed on July 20, 1987, soon to be demolished. 

## A Legacy of Transition

The demolition of the Castaways paved the way for what would become a landmark moment in Las Vegas history: The [Mirage](/posts/mirage-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/). Wynn’s mega-resort, opening in November 1989, completely redefined the Strip, introducing a new scale of entertainment and luxury. While the Castaways may be gone, its story is a poignant reminder of the constant evolution – and occasional disappearance – of vintage Las Vegas, and how even a short chapter can contribute to the overall narrative of this iconic city.
