## A Sans Souci Reborn: The Birth of Castaways

The Las Vegas Strip has always been a landscape of reinvention, and the story of the Castaways Hotel and Casino is a perfect illustration. Before it became a footnote in Strip history, the location was home to the Sans Souci, a hotel that unfortunately found itself in financial trouble. Enter Ben Jaffe, a savvy investor and then-owner of the Tropicana. In a bold move, Jaffe acquired the Sans Souci in bankruptcy and, almost immediately, announced a dramatic transformation. He envisioned a Polynesian-themed paradise, re-branding the property as the Castaways.

The early 1960s were a period of rapid expansion and stylistic experimentation on the Strip, and the Castaways aimed to capitalize on the then-popular Polynesian craze. Construction began in 1963, adding new rooms to the existing structure and giving the entire property a vibrant, tropical makeover. The grand reopening on September 1, 1963, promised guests an escape – a taste of the South Pacific right in the heart of the desert. Ike P. LaRue and Everett Eugene McCarlie managed the casino operations initially, hoping to revitalize the property’s fortunes.

## A Brief Spark and a Big Name Acquisition

Unfortunately, the initial gamble didn't pan out quite as planned. While the Castaways certainly had a distinctive aesthetic, the casino struggled financially. It shuttered its doors unexpectedly on December 3, 1964, leaving the hotel portion to continue operating, albeit under a cloud of uncertainty. This is where a monumental figure enters the narrative: Howard Hughes.

Hughes, the legendary aviation magnate and Las Vegas dealmaker, saw potential in the Castaways. In 1967, he agreed to purchase the property for a substantial $3.3 million. Hughes’ acquisition marked a significant turning point. He recognized the valuable Strip real estate and, while not immediately drastically altering the hotel’s identity, he started making improvements geared toward attracting larger audiences. A new, significantly larger showroom stage was added in 1969, showcasing headliners and attracting a broader entertainment-seeking crowd. Further casino renovations followed in 1971 and again in 1981.

## Demise and a Legacy of Mega-Resorts

The Castaways operated under Hughes’ ownership for over a decade, enduring as a quirky, slightly offbeat presence on the Strip. However, the era of mega-resorts was dawning. In 1986, Steve Wynn, the visionary behind Golden Nugget and soon-to-be-Strip titan, purchased the Castaways for a staggering $50 million. Wynn’s plan was ambitious: to demolish the existing structure and build a completely new resort.

The Castaways officially closed its doors on July 20, 1987, a bittersweet moment for its 228 rooms and 650 employees. Just over a year later, on November 22, 1989, The Mirage, Wynn’s ambitious “mega-resort,” opened on the site, fundamentally changing the Las Vegas Strip.  The Mirage’s themed environment, elaborate volcano show, and sheer scale set a new standard for Strip resorts, proving that bigger and bolder was the future. The Castaways, a brief but vibrant chapter in Las Vegas history, vanished, leaving behind a legacy of stylistic experimentation and paving the way for the mega-resorts that would define the late 20th and early 21st-century Strip.
