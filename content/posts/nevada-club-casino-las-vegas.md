## From Turf Club to Downtown Fun Spot: The Early Days

The 100 block of Fremont Street in Las Vegas was once a pulsing heart of neon and excitement, and nestled just south of the Golden Nugget’s iconic sign sat the Nevada Club Casino. But its story begins before the Nevada Club name even existed. Originally, the site at 113 East Fremont Street started life as the Santa Anita Turf Club in the late 1940s. This early iteration catered to a racing and sports betting crowd, a common theme for early Las Vegas casinos. However, in July 1953, a significant shift occurred as the property was re-licensed as the Nevada Club.

## The "Slot Machine War" and Robert Van Santen’s Innovation

The mid-1950s saw the Nevada Club really begin to define its identity. Under the ownership and operational expertise of Robert Van Santen (who also ran the nearby [Fortune Club](/posts/fortune-club-hotel-and-casino-las-legas/)), the casino embraced its downtown location, positioning itself as “Your Downtown Fun Spot” and “The Jackpot Spot.” This wasn’t just marketing fluff; Van Santen revolutionized the slot machine experience. He initiated what became known as the "Great Las Vegas Slot Machine War" by offering incredibly generous jackpots and introducing groundbreaking features. These included bells, revolving-light beacons, and crucially, a hollow payoff tray. That tray amplified the satisfying clatter of falling coins, a sound that resonated across Fremont Street and lured in even more players. These sensory additions were genuinely innovative and are considered precursors to many modern slot machine features.

## A Merger and a Brighter Marquee

1957 marked a pivotal physical transformation. The Fortune Club, Nevada Club, and a neighboring Western Union office were combined, resulting in a significantly larger Nevada Club. This merger wasn't just about square footage; it meant a dazzling new marquee – a massive 75-foot neon creation that stretched across several storefronts. This addition added considerable neon power to the already vibrant Fremont Street skyline, becoming a key element of the visual identity of [Glitter Gulch](/posts/glitter-gulch-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/).

## Branding Changes and a Unique Layout

Over the years, the Nevada Club continued to evolve. Van Santen, always looking for an edge, cycled through names like Diamond Jim's Nevada Club and [Lucky](/posts/lucky-casino-las-vegas/) Nevada Club, each reflecting a slightly different branding strategy. Despite these changes, the casino remained a consistent mid-sized hall packed with slot machines, low-limit table games, and a popular bar. A particularly ingenious feature of the bar was its architecture, with holes cut through the ceiling allowing cocktail servers to deliver drinks to adjacent clubs without needing to cross Fremont Street – a testament to the interconnectedness of the early Fremont Street casinos.

## Lost But Not Forgotten

Sadly, the Nevada Club’s run ended abruptly in 1969 when the Golden Nugget expanded westward, absorbing the building and essentially taking over the entire south side of the 100 block. While the physical casino is gone, its legacy lives on in vintage postcards, matchbooks, and photographs. These relics serve as a poignant reminder of the tight, neon-packed casinos that helped define classic downtown Las Vegas and the innovative spirit that fueled its early boom.
