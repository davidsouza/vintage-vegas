## A Downtown Classic: The Nevada Club's Rise on Fremont Street

Before the mega-resorts and sprawling Strip, downtown Las Vegas, known as Glitter Gulch, pulsed with a unique energy. Amongst its vital organs was the Nevada Club Casino, a now-vanished landmark located at 113 East Fremont Street. Squeezed between the Lucky Strike and the burgeoning Golden Nugget, the Nevada Club was a quintessential mid-century casino, a testament to a more approachable and boisterous era of Las Vegas gambling.

Initially opening in the late 1940s as the Santa Anita Turf Club – focusing on racing and sports betting – the property underwent a transformation in 1953, receiving a new license and the name Nevada Club. Ownership changed hands a few times before Robert Van Santen, also running the neighboring Fortune Club, took the reins. This marked a turning point, as Van Santen actively cultivated a “Downtown Fun Spot” persona, moving away from high-roller exclusivity and focusing on accessible gaming and a lively atmosphere.

## The Slot Machine Wars and Sensory Overload

Van Santen's vision wasn't just about welcoming players; it was about *enticing* them. He ignited what became known as “The Great Las Vegas Slot Machine War” by offering significantly higher jackpots than his competitors. But Van Santen didn’t stop there. He introduced innovations that would become industry standards. He added bells and revolving-light beacons to his slot machines – visual and auditory cues that amplified the excitement of potential wins. Perhaps most famously, the payoff trays were hollow, creating a satisfying cascade of coin sounds that resonated throughout the casino, drawing crowds and advertising the big payouts.

## Expanding the Neon Frontier

The 1950s brought a significant physical change. In 1957, a bold move saw the Nevada Club, Fortune Club, and the adjoining Western Union office combine into a single, much larger entity. The result was a stunning new, roughly 75-foot-long marquee stretching across multiple storefronts – a major neon addition to Fremont Street’s already dazzling skyline.

## Shifting Identities and a Legacy Lost

Under Van Santen’s continued stewardship, the casino cycled through names like Diamond Jim’s Nevada Club and Lucky Nevada Club, reflecting ownership changes and competitive branding efforts. Despite the name changes, the core experience remained consistent: a mid-sized casino filled with slots, low-limit tables, and a unique architectural quirk – holes cut in the ceilings to allow cocktail servers to service neighboring clubs without traversing the busy street.

Sadly, the Nevada Club’s story came to an end in 1969 when the Golden Nugget, undergoing a westward expansion, absorbed the building, effectively erasing it from the Fremont Street landscape. Today, the Nevada Club exists primarily in vintage postcards, gaming guides, matchbooks, and photographs – treasured artifacts that offer a glimpse into the tight-packed, neon-drenched heart of classic downtown Las Vegas. They serve as a powerful reminder of a different era, a different feel, and a different kind of Vegas.
