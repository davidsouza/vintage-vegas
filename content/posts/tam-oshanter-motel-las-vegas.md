## A Friendly Face on the Strip: Introducing the Tam O’Shanter Motel

Before the mega-resorts and sprawling complexes dominated the Las Vegas Strip, there were the classic motor courts – charming, family-run establishments that offered a welcoming respite for travelers. Among the most memorable of these was the Tam O’Shanter Motel, a beloved landmark located at 3317 South Las Vegas Boulevard, nestled between the iconic [Sands](/posts/sands-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) and [Desert Inn](/posts/desert-inn-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/). Opened in 1959 by Bernie Zeldin, this 100-room inn was more than just a place to sleep; it was a symbol of a different era of Vegas hospitality.

## Mid-Century Modern Comfort and Quirky Charm

The name itself – drawn from Zeldin’s fondness for a Chicago golf course – hinted at a touch of playful personality. But the real draw was the motel’s commitment to providing its guests with comforts unheard of at the time. Free televisions in every room, telephones, steam heat, cooled refrigeration – these were lavish amenities for the late 1950s and early 1960s. And of course, a heated swimming pool was a huge draw for those scorching Vegas summers. The motel’s marketing emphasized its friendly atmosphere, and the slogan “Friendly Inn, Pool Open, Free Coffee” painted a welcoming picture to weary travelers.

## The Rotating Neon Cap: A Striking Landmark

What truly set the Tam O’Shanter apart was its magnificent neon marquee: a colossal, rotating tam o’shanter cap. This twinkling spectacle became a defining feature of the Strip, instantly recognizable and a beacon for those seeking a comfortable and friendly stay. Even after decades, stories persist about the motel's quirky and enduring features - some rooms supposedly still sported shag carpet and even coin-operated “1,000-fingers” bed massage machines, adding to the motel's unique character.

## A Family Legacy and a Bittersweet End

The Zeldin family ran the Tam O’Shanter Motel for an impressive 45 years, a testament to their dedication and commitment to hospitality. Bernie’s daughter, Leah Zeldin, carried on the family legacy until the motel’s closure in January 2004. Sadly, the rise of mega-resorts made its existence unsustainable. In 1998, Las Vegas Sands acquired the site, and the Tam O’Shanter was ultimately demolished to make way for the Palazzo. While the building is gone, its spirit lives on. Thankfully, the iconic neon cap was rescued and preserved by the Las Vegas Neon Museum, ensuring that future generations can appreciate this enduring symbol of vintage Las Vegas.  The Tam O'Shanter Motel reminds us of a time when the Strip was smaller, friendlier, and full of unique character – a time we can still experience through postcards, photographs, and cherished memories.
