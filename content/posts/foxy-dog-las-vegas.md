# A Downtown Bite and a Little Bit of Luck: Remembering Foxy Dog Las Vegas

Downtown Las Vegas in the 1960s and 70s was a vibrant, chaotic, and undeniably *local* experience. Forget the mega-resorts – the heart of the action beat on Fremont Street, fueled by neon, cheap eats, and the ever-present clang of slot machines. And nestled among the pioneers was a small, but memorable, establishment: Foxy Dog. 

## More Than Just a Hot Dog Stand

Located at 326 Fremont Street, Foxy Dog wasn’t your average vendor. Owned by Abe and Evelyn Fox, the same folks behind Foxy’s Deli and Restaurant on the Strip, it was an experiment in blending classic diner fare with low-key gambling. The Foxes clearly understood the Fremont Street vibe; they sought to create a place where locals (and tourists seeking a more authentic experience) could grab a quick bite and try their luck.  They applied for, and received, a gaming license in 1964, allowing for 18 slot machines to operate alongside the hot dog counter.  A 1964 *Las Vegas Sun* article playfully dubbed it “the hottest dog in town,” placing it right beside the popular Trader Bill's.

## A Slice of Fremont Street Life

Foxy Dog embodied the spirit of old Fremont. It wasn’t about glitz and glamour; it was about casual fun. The menu was simple: hot dogs, obviously, but also a comfortable, familiar offering for the working class. Alongside the food, you'd find a collection of slot machines and pinball machines, adding a layer of entertainment. This mix attracted a steady stream of foot traffic and fostered a friendly, neighborhood atmosphere.

## The Ups and Downs of Running a Downtown Business

Of course, life wasn’t always smooth. Foxy Dog’s gaming license spanned from 1964 to 1975 and then again from 1975 to 1989, demonstrating the complexities of ownership and regulatory changes in Las Vegas. The establishment faced its share of challenges – a janitor’s theft and an early morning armed robbery highlighting the risks inherent in operating a business in the city’s bustling downtown core. 

## Foxy Dog's Legacy

As Downtown Las Vegas evolved, larger casinos began to dominate the landscape, pushing out many of the smaller, locally-owned businesses. Foxy Dog was no exception.  The establishment closed its doors in 1989, leaving behind a void that reflects a significant change in Las Vegas’s identity.  Today, Foxy Dog exists primarily in memory – a potent symbol of the classic Fremont Street experience, the entrepreneurial spirit that built Las Vegas, and a reminder of a time when a simple hot dog and a few coins could offer a taste of the good life.
