## A Strip-Side Surprise: The El Morocco Arrives

The 1960s Las Vegas Strip was a whirlwind of development, each new property vying for attention and pushing the boundaries of entertainment and design. Among these rising stars was the El Morocco Motel and Casino, opening its doors in 1964 between the iconic [La Concha Motel](/posts/la-concha-motel-las-vegas/) and the still-standing Peppermill Restaurant. It’s a location that feels almost perfectly positioned today, but back then it was a key piece of a rapidly evolving landscape. Owned by Lorenzo Doumani, who also had a hand in the La Concha, the El Morocco offered a blend of modern convenience and sleek, futuristic style.

## Paul Williams' Googie Masterpiece

The design, meticulously crafted by the renowned architect Paul Revere Williams, immediately distinguished the El Morocco. It shared a strikingly similar Googie aesthetic with its sister property, the La Concha, characterized by its sweeping lines, geometric shapes, and eye-catching signage – a true reflection of the optimism and forward-thinking spirit of the era. Googie architecture was all about drawing customers in with its vibrant energy, and the El Morocco certainly did that.

## Banking on Vegas Glamour – Literally!

What truly set the El Morocco apart upon opening was its unique inclusion of a Bank of Las Vegas branch *right in the lobby*. This wasn't just any branch; it was a completely novel concept in 1964, offering guests and locals alike a seamless blend of financial services and leisure. Imagine conducting your banking while enjoying the sights and sounds of a Las Vegas casino – a unique experience reflecting the evolving nature of the city.  

## Dining & Diversions

Beyond banking and gaming, the El Morocco catered to a full spectrum of guest needs. Restaurateur Jack Dennison launched his popular Copper Cart restaurant (later rebranded as the Carving Cart), becoming a Vegas staple. Visitors could also enjoy a quick bite at the coffee shop, unwind with a cocktail at the lounge, or get pampered at the beauty salon. These amenities were indicative of the mid-60s focus on providing a complete and convenient experience for travelers.

## Demise and Legacy

The 1970s brought changes. The groundbreaking bank branch was replaced with a casino, reflecting the growing dominance of gambling on the Strip.  The casino ultimately transitioned into a gift shop in 1983, followed by a succession of different tenants, including a Korean restaurant. By the 2000s, it had become a souvenir store and Internet café. Sadly, the El Morocco was demolished in stages – parts in 2006, the remainder in 2008 – leaving behind only memories and photographs. Now owned by The Siegel Group, the site sits vacant, with whispers of future development potentially including another hotel/casino. Though gone, the El Morocco remains a beloved footnote in Las Vegas history, a testament to a time when innovation and style reigned supreme on the Strip.
