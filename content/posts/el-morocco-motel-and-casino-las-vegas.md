## A Slice of Mid-Century Strip Charm: The El Morocco's Debut

Between the iconic [La Concha Motel](/posts/la-concha-motel-las-vegas/) and the ever-glamorous Peppermill Restaurant, a lesser-remembered gem once sparkled on the Las Vegas Strip: the El Morocco Motel and Casino. Opening its doors in 1964, it represented a new kind of convenience and style, a hallmark of the burgeoning Las Vegas experience. Owned by Lorenzo Doumani, the same visionary behind the La Concha, the El Morocco’s design owed a distinct debt to the brilliant architect Paul Revere Williams. Like its sister property, it epitomized the Googie architectural aesthetic – all sharp angles, swooping curves, and a futuristic, optimistic vibe.

## Banking on Fun: A Unique Feature

What truly set the El Morocco apart was its unexpected amenity: a full-service branch of the Bank of Las Vegas housed right in the lobby. Imagine stepping off the Strip, ready to gamble, but needing to deposit a check first! This innovative combination was unheard of and a powerful statement about the increasingly integrated nature of entertainment and commerce in Las Vegas. It reflected a desire to cater to the evolving needs of visitors, providing not just entertainment, but also practical services.

## Dining and Diversions

The El Morocco offered a full suite of amenities beyond the casino and bank. Restaurateur Jack Dennison launched his popular Copper Cart restaurant (later rebranded as the Carving Cart), a Vegas staple for years. Guests could also grab a quick bite at the coffee shop, enjoy a cocktail at the lounge, or freshen up at the beauty salon. It was a complete destination.

## Evolution and Demise

Like many Las Vegas properties, the El Morocco adapted to changing times. In the 1970s, the novelty of the bank had faded, and its space was transformed into a casino. However, the casino’s run was relatively short-lived; it transitioned to a gift shop in 1983. The lobby itself evolved too, eventually housing a Korean restaurant. By the turn of the millennium, the El Morocco morphed into a souvenir store and Internet cafe, a far cry from its original vision.

Sadly, the El Morocco's story ended in demolition. Parts were removed in 2006, and the entire structure was gone by 2008. Currently, the site remains vacant, awaiting redevelopment by The Siegel Group, with plans potentially including a new hotel/casino. Though lost, the El Morocco Motel and Casino serves as a reminder of a different era on the Las Vegas Strip – a time of innovation, architectural flair, and a unique blend of entertainment and everyday services. It’s a chapter we won’t forget.
