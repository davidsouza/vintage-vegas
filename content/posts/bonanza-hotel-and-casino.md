## A Quick Start and Early Troubles

The Las Vegas Strip of the late 1960s was a whirlwind of development, competition, and ambition. Amidst the glitter and promise, the Bonanza Hotel and Casino burst onto the scene on July 1, 1967. Located at 3645 South Las Vegas Boulevard – a prime Strip location now occupied by the Horseshoe – the Bonanza aimed to capture the burgeoning western theme so popular at the time. Situated strategically between the Three Coins and the Galaxy Motel, it even utilized those establishments for overflow lodging, a common practice as the Strip’s resorts grew rapidly.

The Bonanza was a relatively modest venture compared to the sprawling mega-resorts that were starting to emerge. With just 160 rooms, it catered to a different clientele than the larger hotels – a distinction that would be both a strength and a weakness. However, early financial difficulties plagued the property. Just three months after opening, the casino portion was forced to close, though the hotel itself remained operational. This initial setback hinted at the turbulent journey that lay ahead.

## Kirk Kerkorian & A Second Chance

The Bonanza's fortunes took a turn at the end of 1968 when legendary Las Vegas developer Kirk Kerkorian, a true titan of the Strip, stepped in and purchased the property. Kerkorian, known for his savvy investments and massive projects, seemed poised to revive the Bonanza. True to form, he quickly sold it on to a group of investors a few months later, signaling a potential for a fresh start.

The casino reopened in May 1969, breathing new life into the southern Strip. This period saw the Bonanza carve out a niche for itself. It featured a showroom and a small theater that screened classic films, providing entertainment beyond just gambling. Most notably, the casino became a hotspot for country music. In a landmark moment, country music legend Buck Owens, fresh off his "Hee-Haw" fame, made his Las Vegas Strip debut at the Bonanza in 1969. It was a defining moment, solidifying the property's appeal to a specific, growing demographic.

## Legal Battles and a Final Closure

However, the peace was short-lived. A dispute erupted between the two top investors concerning the hotel's management, culminating in a bitter legal battle. Thankfully, a settlement was reached, but the instability clearly affected the Bonanza's long-term prospects. Ironically, Kerkorian again entered the picture in 1970, filing a foreclosure action and reclaiming control.

The Bonanza's final curtain fell in early 1973. Though its time on the Strip was brief, the Bonanza Hotel and Casino holds a unique place in Las Vegas history – a snapshot of a rapidly evolving industry, a testament to the ambition of its early investors, and a cherished memory for those who remember its country music charm. Today, the site is home to the Horseshoe Las Vegas, a far cry from the western-themed, smaller-scale Bonanza, but the legacy of its brief, turbulent run lives on in the stories of vintage Las Vegas.
