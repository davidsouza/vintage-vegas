# A Brief Blaze on the Strip: The Bonanza Hotel & Casino

The Las Vegas Strip has seen its share of comings and goings, of glitz and glamour, and of ambitious ventures that ultimately faded away. Among these fleeting lights was the Bonanza Hotel & Casino, a western-themed property that existed for a mere six years (1967-1973) before succumbing to financial woes and ownership squabbles. Today, its footprint is occupied by the Horseshoe Las Vegas, but the memory of the Bonanza remains a fascinating glimpse into a specific era of Vegas development.

## A Quick Start and a Faster Shutdown

The Bonanza opened on July 1, 1967, nestled between the Three Coins and the Galaxy Motel. It was a relatively modest resort, offering just 160 rooms, significantly smaller than the burgeoning mega-resorts that were starting to define the Strip. Interestingly, the Galaxy Motel served as overflow lodging for the Bonanza, hinting at early struggles with occupancy. Unfortunately, those struggles proved too much; just three months after its grand opening, the casino portion was forced to close. However, the hotel itself managed to remain operational.

## Kerkorian's Brief Involvement and Renewed Hope

The Bonanza's fortunes shifted when the legendary Kirk Kerkorian, a titan of Las Vegas development and known for his philanthropy, acquired the property at the end of 1968. Kerkorian, always seeking to expand and improve, quickly sold it to a new group of investors, who in turn, reopened the casino in May 1969. This marked a period of renewed optimism and a shift in focus. The Bonanza quickly carved out a niche, becoming a popular spot for country music fans.

## Country Music and Classic Films

The Bonanza wasn't just a casino and hotel; it was a destination. It featured a showroom that regularly hosted live entertainment, and a theater showcasing classic films – a unique offering for the time. The casino itself became synonymous with country music. A pivotal moment arrived in 1969 when country music legend Buck Owens, a star of *Hee Haw*, made his Las Vegas Strip debut at the Bonanza, solidifying its connection to the genre.

## Legal Battles and the Inevitable End

The brief period of success wasn’t without turmoil. Internal disagreements between the top two investors regarding management led to a bitter legal battle, ultimately resolved through a settlement. However, this disruption, combined with ongoing financial difficulties, proved fatal. In 1970, Kerkorian, ever the keen businessman, reasserted control through a foreclosure action, proving that even a brief ownership stint couldn’t insulate the property from deeper problems. The Bonanza finally closed its doors in early 1973. While its lifespan was short, the Bonanza Hotel & Casino remains a memorable blip on the timeline of the Las Vegas Strip, a reminder of the boom-and-bust nature of the industry and the ever-evolving landscape of Sin City.
