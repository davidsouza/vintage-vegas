## From Antiques to Acceptance: The Red Barn's Early Years

Before the glitz and grandeur of modern Las Vegas, a much quieter corner of the city held a hidden gem: The Red Barn. Located at 1317 Bond Road, just off Tropicana Avenue, this unlikely spot began its life in 1958 as a quaint antique store. Imagine travelers along a less-traveled route stopping to browse unique vintage treasures – a far cry from the bustling scene the area would later embrace. However, the store’s destiny took a dramatic turn in the early 1960s when new owners envisioned a different kind of entertainment. It was transformed into a cocktail lounge and bar, establishing itself as a neighborhood gathering spot.

## A Safe Harbor and the Rise of the RB Follies

The Red Barn's significance truly blossomed under the ownership of Albert “Bert” Hood, starting around 1972. Recognizing a need within the community, Hood boldly embraced the venue’s role as one of Las Vegas’s earliest openly gay bars. This wasn’t just about serving drinks; it was about creating a safe and vibrant space for a population often marginalized. The institution truly cemented its place in Vegas history with the introduction of the legendary “RB Follies” drag show. 

These shows weren't mere performances; they were a cultural phenomenon. For decades, the Red Barn hosted a staggering 17,781 performances, a testament to their popularity and enduring appeal. The RB Follies provided a platform for talented performers and a vital source of entertainment for a loyal following. The bar also distributed the RB Bag, an early LGBTQ+ newsletter, further strengthening its connection to the community and providing vital information and support.

## Shadows and Loss: The Final Curtain

The 1980s brought increasing social challenges and anxieties, casting a shadow over the Red Barn’s vibrant atmosphere. Bert Hood himself suffered a brutal assault, permanently impacting his hearing and serving as a stark reminder of the dangers faced by the LGBTQ+ community. Coupled with mounting financial pressures and a shifting social landscape, the Red Barn ultimately closed its doors in March 1988. The loss was deeply felt. Tragically, later that year, the abandoned building succumbed to a devastating fire.

## A Neon Legacy Lives On

While the physical structure may be gone, the Red Barn’s legacy lives on. Recognizing its historical importance, the Allied Arts Council spearheaded an effort to save the iconic red neon sign featuring a giant martini glass. Today, it proudly stands as part of the Neon Museum’s collection, a shimmering reminder of a pioneering Vegas establishment and a testament to the courage and resilience of the LGBTQ+ community. It serves as a beacon, illuminating a significant chapter in vintage Las Vegas history.
