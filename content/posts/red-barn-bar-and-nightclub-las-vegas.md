## From Antiques to Acceptance: The Early Years

The story of the Red Barn Bar and Nightclub isn't your typical Las Vegas Strip narrative. Located at 1317 Bond Road, far from the glittering casinos, its beginnings were remarkably humble. Opened in 1958 as an antique store, it catered to the curious travelers venturing along a quieter stretch of road, close to Tropicana and Maryland Parkway. Imagine browsing vintage furniture and curiosities – a stark contrast to the glamorous image often associated with Las Vegas. However, a significant shift occurred in the early 1960s when new ownership transformed the shop into a cocktail lounge and bar. It started as a general entertainment venue, but a unique identity soon began to emerge.

## Bert Hood & the Rise of the RB Follies

The real magic of the Red Barn began with Albert “Bert” Hood, who took over management around 1972. Hood’s vision was transformative, and he boldly embraced the bar's burgeoning role within the burgeoning LGBTQ+ community. This wasn't just about serving drinks; it was about creating a safe and vibrant space. And it was the legendary "RB Follies" drag show that cemented the Red Barn’s place in Las Vegas history.

The RB Follies became *the* entertainment draw, a dazzling spectacle of talent, humor, and unapologetic self-expression. The show ran for an unbelievable 17,781 performances – a testament to its popularity and the community it served. Think of it: nearly nightly entertainment, year after year! The Red Barn wasn’t simply a bar; it was a haven, a gathering place, and a beacon of acceptance in a time when such spaces were rare.  Beyond the performances, the Red Barn also pioneered communication within the LGBTQ+ community through the "RB Bag," one of the earliest LGBTQ+ newsletters in Southern Nevada.

## Challenges and Closure

The 1980s, unfortunately, brought a darker chapter.  Like much of the country, Las Vegas faced growing social and political challenges related to LGBTQ+ rights. The atmosphere at the Red Barn became increasingly tense, and Bert Hood himself suffered a brutal assault that left him permanently deaf in one ear. Combined with financial pressures, these challenges proved insurmountable. In March 1988, the Red Barn closed its doors, marking the end of an era. Tragically, the building itself was lost to a devastating fire later that same year.

## A Lasting Legacy in Neon

Despite its physical disappearance, the Red Barn’s legacy endures.  Recognizing its importance, the Allied Arts Council initiated a signage rescue, and the bar’s iconic red neon sign – featuring that unforgettable giant martini glass – was salvaged.  Today, the sign stands proudly at the Neon Museum, a vibrant reminder of the Red Barn’s trailblazing spirit and its vital role in Las Vegas’s LGBTQ+ history. It serves as a powerful symbol of a place that welcomed, celebrated, and fought for a community, leaving an indelible mark on the vintage landscape of Las Vegas.
