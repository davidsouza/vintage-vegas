## From Antiques to Acceptance: The Early Years

Few places in Las Vegas history had as multifaceted a beginning as The Red Barn. Located at 1317 Bond Road, a bit off the then-emerging Strip near Tropicana and Maryland Parkway, it started in 1958 not as a raucous nightclub, but as an antique store. Imagine travelers, venturing beyond the main casino drag, stopping by to peruse vintage treasures – a unique offering in a town still defining its identity. The early 1960s saw a significant shift. New ownership reimagined the space, transforming it into a cocktail lounge and bar. While initially a general entertainment spot, it slowly began to cultivate a specific, and vital, identity.

## Bert Hood and the Rise of the RB Follies

The Red Barn's true legacy began with Albert “Bert” Hood, who took over in approximately 1972. Hood recognized an opportunity to create a safe and vibrant space for the LGBTQ+ community, and under his stewardship, The Red Barn fully embraced that role. This era marked the birth of the iconic “RB Follies,” a drag show that became a Las Vegas institution. The Follies weren't just entertainment; they were a celebration of identity and a safe haven for performers and audiences alike.  The astounding run of 17,781 performances is a testament to its popularity and cultural impact – a number that dwarfs many contemporary shows. Alongside the Follies, Hood instituted the “RB Bag,” one of the region’s earliest LGBTQ+ newsletters, further solidifying the bar’s importance in the community.

## A Troubled Decline & Tragic End

Despite its popularity and groundbreaking role, the 1980s brought mounting challenges. The social climate was changing, and the Red Barn faced increasing pressure, both financial and societal. Sadly, Bert Hood himself was the victim of a brutal assault, suffering a permanent hearing loss – a stark reminder of the dangers faced by the LGBTQ+ community at the time. These hardships, combined with financial difficulties, ultimately led to the club’s closure in March 1988.

The tragedy didn't end there. Later that same year, the abandoned building succumbed to a devastating fire, erasing a physical landmark from the Las Vegas landscape. However, a crucial piece of the Red Barn's soul survived: its iconic red neon sign, featuring a giant martini glass.  Saved through the efforts of the Allied Arts Council, it now stands proudly at the Neon Museum, a poignant reminder of a place that helped shape Las Vegas’s history and paved the way for a more inclusive future.
