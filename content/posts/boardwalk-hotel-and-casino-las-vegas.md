## From [Holiday](/posts/holiday-casino-las-vegas/) Inn to Coney Island Escape

Before the soaring heights of CityCenter and the elegance of the Waldorf Astoria graced the Las Vegas Strip, a different kind of spectacle stood proudly: the Boardwalk Hotel & Casino. Its story is a microcosm of the Strip’s evolution, from modest beginnings to a playful, themed identity, and ultimately, to its demolition to make way for modern behemoths. The property’s roots stretch back to 1966, initially a fairly unremarkable Holiday Inn. This six-story structure, designed by Homer Rissman, catered to a growing, but still relatively small, Vegas landscape.

## A Casino Emerges & Identity Shifts

Things started to change in 1977 when the hotel added a gaming component, christened the Slot Joynt Casino. This marked a crucial shift, steering the property towards a casino-hotel model. However, the name “Slot Joynt” didn't quite stick. A few years later, in 1985, it was rebranded again as the Viscount Hotel. It was the 1989 transformation that truly cemented its place in Las Vegas lore.

## Coney Island Comes to Vegas!

The Boardwalk Hotel & Casino was born, and with it, a vibrant, decidedly *different* aesthetic. The property embraced a Coney Island theme, complete with a faux wooden roller coaster (a striking visual for Strip visitors!), a parachute-jump-style ride, and a whimsical façade that immediately set it apart. This wasn’t about sophisticated elegance; it was about joyful, carnival-style fun. The 1995 addition of the “Dreamland” tower, followed by a significant renovation and the construction of a new 16-story Dreamland Tower in 1996, increased the hotel's capacity to 653 rooms and expanded the gaming floor to a respectable 33,000 square feet.

## Surf’s Up & Lasting Memories

No discussion of the Boardwalk is complete without mentioning its Surf Buffet. Open 24 hours, it was a unique offering on the Strip, catering to the city’s insatiable appetite for dining options. While smaller and undeniably kitschy compared to the burgeoning mega-resorts like Bellagio and MGM Grand, the Boardwalk possessed a charm all its own. Its playful spirit and retro design appealed to a specific demographic, offering an alternative to the increasingly opulent, grand casino experiences.

## A Demise & a Legacy

Acquired by [Mirage](/posts/mirage-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Resorts (later MGM Mirage) in 1997, the Boardwalk continued operating until its closure on January 9, 2006. The inevitable implosion occurred on May 9, 2006, at 2:34 a.m., marking the end of an era. Today, the site is unrecognizable, home to the upscale developments of CityCenter. While the Boardwalk is gone, its memory lives on as a quirky, beloved footnote in Las Vegas history – a playful reminder of a time when the Strip embraced a more whimsical and approachable persona.
