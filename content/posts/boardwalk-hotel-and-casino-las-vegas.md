## From Holiday Inn to Boardwalk Dreams: Early Days on the Strip

The Las Vegas Strip has always been about transformation and reinvention. Few properties illustrate this better than the Boardwalk Hotel & Casino. Its story began in 1966, not as a glittering casino-resort, but as a straightforward Holiday Inn. Designed by the talented Homer Rissman, it offered a practical, mid-Strip lodging option – a far cry from the themed extravaganzas that would later define the area. For years, it operated as a quiet contributor to the burgeoning Las Vegas landscape, offering a restaurant, cocktail lounge, and meeting space for business travelers. 

## Slot Joynt & The Viscount: Shifting Sands

The 1970s brought change, as it did for the entire Strip. In 1977, the hotel’s gaming area underwent a rebranding, becoming the “Slot Joynt Casino.” This marked the first significant step toward establishing a true casino-hotel identity. This was followed by another name change in 1985, when the entire property became the Viscount Hotel. While not a total failure, the Viscount never quite captured the imagination of visitors. It needed something… *more*.

## Coney Island Comes to Las Vegas: The Boardwalk Era

And then, in 1989, the transformation was complete. The Viscount vanished, replaced by the wonderfully whimsical Boardwalk Hotel & Casino. Suddenly, the Strip was graced with a faux wooden roller coaster, a parachute jump ride, and a facade evoking the nostalgic charm of Coney Island. This was a deliberate attempt to stand out from the increasingly opulent and themed resorts sprouting up around it. The Boardwalk offered a lighter, more playful atmosphere – a welcome contrast to the grandeur of places like the Mirage or the soon-to-be-built Bellagio.

## A Slice of Retro Fun & the 24-Hour Surf Buffet

The Boardwalk continued to evolve. In 1995, the "Dreamland" tower was added, followed by a significant renovation and the 16-story Dreamland Tower in 1996, bringing the total room count to 653 and expanding the gaming floor to a respectable 33,000 square feet. And let’s not forget the iconic 24-hour Surf Buffet, a truly unique offering on the Strip – a testament to the Boardwalk’s commitment to casual fun and catering to the late-night crowds.

## A Demise and a Legacy

Despite its charm and unique appeal, the Boardwalk ultimately couldn't compete with the scale and marketing power of the mega-resorts. In 1997, it was acquired by Mirage Resorts (later MGM Mirage). Its time, however, was limited. In 2006, the Boardwalk closed its doors to make way for the ambitious CityCenter development, and on May 9th of that year, its main tower was dramatically imploded. 

Today, the site of the Boardwalk is unrecognizable, occupied by luxury hotels like the Waldorf Astoria (formerly Mandarin Oriental), the Aria, and the high-end shopping destination, The Shops at Crystals. While the physical structure is gone, the memory of the Boardwalk – a quirky, Coney Island-themed escape on the Las Vegas Strip – endures as a charming and fondly remembered footnote in the history of this ever-evolving city.
