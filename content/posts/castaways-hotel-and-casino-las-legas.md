## A [Sans Souci](/posts/sans-souci-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Transformation

The Las Vegas Strip has seen countless resorts rise and fall, each leaving a unique mark on the city's ever-evolving narrative. Today, we’re diving into the story of the [Castaways Hotel and Casino](/posts/castaways-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), a relatively brief but fascinating chapter in vintage Las Vegas history. It began not as the Castaways, however. In the early 1960s, the property was the Sans Souci, struggling financially. Enter Ben Jaffe, a shrewd investor who also owned the [Tropicana](/posts/tropicana-country-club-las-vegas/). Recognizing potential, Jaffe scooped up the Sans Souci in bankruptcy and, with a bold vision, announced a complete overhaul and a new name: The Castaways.

The 1963 reopening as the Castaways was a significant event. The theme, Polynesian, was popular in Las Vegas at the time, mirroring the success of the nearby Polynesian Hotel (now the [Sahara](/posts/sahara-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/)). Lush landscaping, tiki bars, and a generally relaxed, escapist atmosphere aimed to transport guests to a tropical paradise, a welcome respite from the desert heat. Ike P. LaRue and Everett Eugene McCarlie managed the casino, promising a vibrant gambling experience. While initially popular, financial challenges quickly resurfaced. The casino, despite its enticing atmosphere, couldn't sustain itself. By December 1964, it was forced to close, although the hotel operations continued.

## The Hughes Era and Evolution

The Castaways’ fortunes took a surprising turn in 1967. Howard Hughes, the legendary aviation mogul and Vegas power player, stepped in and purchased the property for $3.3 million. Hughes, known for his long-term investments and vision for the Strip, saw potential where others didn’t. He significantly improved the hotel, adding a larger showroom stage to cater to big-name entertainment – a hallmark of Hughes’s Las Vegas strategy. Subsequent renovations in 1971 and again in 1981 continued to modernize the property, albeit while retaining some of its original Polynesian charm.

## A Final Chapter and Legacy

The Castaways enjoyed a comparatively stable period under Hughes’s ownership, becoming a familiar landmark on the Strip. However, the winds of change were inevitable. In 1986, Steve Wynn acquired the property for a staggering $50 million, a testament to its prime location. Wynn's plan wasn't to simply refurbish the Castaways, but to demolish it entirely and build something truly groundbreaking: The [Mirage](/posts/mirage-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/). The Mirage, opening in 1989, ushered in the era of the mega-resort, forever altering the visual landscape of the Las Vegas Strip. The Castaways closed its doors on July 20, 1987, leaving behind 228 rooms and a team of 650 employees.

While the Castaways is now just a memory and a footprint in the sand, it stands as a reminder of the rapid evolution and constant reinvention that defines Las Vegas. It represents a fleeting moment of Polynesian escapism on the Strip, a chapter shaped by financial struggles, a visionary investor, and ultimately, the dawn of a new era in Las Vegas history.
