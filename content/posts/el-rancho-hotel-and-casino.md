# The Dawn of the Strip: Remembering El Rancho Vegas

Vintage Las Vegas conjures images of neon lights, big band music, and a sense of boundless possibility. And it all, arguably, began with [El Rancho Hotel and Casino](/posts/el-rancho-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/). Opened on April 3, 1941, it wasn't just another hotel; it was the *first* resort on what would become the famed Las Vegas Strip, then known as Highway 91 in Winchester, Nevada. Its impact on the development of Las Vegas is undeniable.

## A Vision for the Desert

Developer Tommy Hull, recognizing the potential of attracting Los Angeles travelers to Nevada, envisioned a resort catering to that market. He brought in architect Wayne McAllister, who crafted a design centered around 65 charming, Old West-themed cottage bungalows, a deliberate choice to evoke a rustic, romantic atmosphere appealing to visitors seeking a unique experience.

El Rancho was more than just lodging; it was entertainment. It featured a casino, a rodeo arena (a real draw!), a swimming pool, and a lush, landscaped setting, all quite extravagant for the area at the time. The resort also pioneered the all-you-can-eat buffet concept in Las Vegas, a feature that remains a staple of the city's dining scene to this day, showcasing its commitment to customer satisfaction and lavish indulgence.

## Rise and Fall of an Icon

El Rancho's success spurred a chain reaction. Its presence validated the idea of building resorts along Highway 91, paving the way for the Flamingo, [Sahara](/posts/sahara-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), and the others that would eventually define the Las Vegas Strip. The resort passed through several ownerships throughout the 1950s, each attempting to build on the original vision. However, tragedy struck on June 17, 1960, when a devastating fire engulfed the main building. While the charming cottages miraculously survived, the heart of El Rancho was lost.

Despite rebuilding efforts, El Rancho Vegas ultimately closed its doors permanently. The site, sold to Howard Hughes in 1970, remained vacant for decades, a silent testament to a bygone era. Numerous redevelopment plans were proposed and scrapped, mirroring the fluctuating fortunes of Las Vegas itself.

## Legacy & Rebirth (of Sorts)

Today, the land once occupied by El Rancho Vegas exists as the Las Vegas Festival Grounds, an open-air venue operated by MGM Resorts [International](/posts/international-hotel-las-vegas/) (until 2019, when it was sold to Phil Ruffin). While the original buildings are long gone, the legacy of El Rancho Vegas endures. It represents the birth of the Las Vegas Strip, a pivotal moment in the city's transformation from a dusty desert town to a global entertainment destination. Remembering El Rancho is remembering the very roots of modern Las Vegas.
