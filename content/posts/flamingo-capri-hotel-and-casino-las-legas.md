## A Unique Spot on the Strip: The Flamingo Capri Emerges

When you think of classic Las Vegas, towering resorts and dazzling spectacle immediately come to mind. But the evolution of the Strip wasn't always about mega-hotels. Tucked between the pioneering Flamingo Hotel and what’s now The LINQ, the Flamingo Capri Hotel and Casino quietly played a crucial role in that transition. Opened on October 30, 1959, by George E. Goldberg and Bill Capri (whose last name gave the motel its distinctive suffix), the Capri was a luxury motel aiming to offer something different. For roughly $2 million, they built a 180-room haven that skillfully bridged the gap between the older motor court era and the burgeoning resort era.

## More Than Just Flamingo Overflow

What made the Flamingo Capri truly special was its symbiotic relationship with its neighbor. Guests enjoyed access to many of the Flamingo’s amenities—pools, dining, even some hotel services—but at a more approachable price point. Early advertising emphasized modern conveniences: air conditioning, telephones, televisions, and 24-hour food service. This positioning established the Capri as an upscale, yet accessible alternative, attracting a wider range of visitors.

The motel's design, courtesy of architects Douglas Honnold and John Rex, mirrored this appeal. The low-rise structure’s motor court layout, with rooms clustered around landscaped parking courts, created a relaxed and inviting atmosphere – a welcome departure from the increasingly grand and formal resorts popping up.

## A Bit of Creative Marketing (and a Flooded Canal?)

In 1964, the Flamingo Capri Restaurant solidified its identity, establishing the property as a destination in its own right. Then there was the infamous “Flamingo Wash.” Clever marketing spun the natural drainage channel beneath the property into a romantic “Venetian canal,” a bit of Vegas flair that became significantly less charming when periodic flooding became a reality. While it provided a memorable story, the wash undoubtedly added a quirky chapter to the Capri’s history.

## Engelstad’s Vision and the Rise of the Imperial Palace

The 1970s brought significant changes. Ralph Engelstad, a contractor and entrepreneur, acquired the Flamingo Capri in 1971. He quickly recognized the property’s potential and transformed it. A casino was added in 1972, followed by expansions, including the popular Shangri-La pool, in 1974. By 1976, it even operated under the Best Western banner, retaining the beloved Flamingo Capri name.

Engelstad’s ambition ultimately led to the property’s transformation into something entirely new. In 1977, construction began on a towering 19-story structure. On November 1, 1979, the Flamingo Capri faded into history as the entire complex was rebranded as the Imperial Palace. The original Capri casino building was demolished to make way for the new entrance.

## A Legacy Lives On

While the Flamingo Capri name vanished, its impact remains. Sections of the original motel rooms continued to operate under the Imperial Palace for years, and now some persist within The LINQ. The Flamingo Capri represents a fascinating and often overlooked chapter in Las Vegas’s evolution—a time when the Strip was finding its stride, bridging the old with the new, and crafting the unique identity that defines Las Vegas today.
