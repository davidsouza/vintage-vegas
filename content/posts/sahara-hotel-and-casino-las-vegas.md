## A Desert Dream Takes Shape: The Sahara’s Debut

Before the mega-resorts and dazzling spectacles we associate with the Las Vegas Strip today, there was the Sahara Hotel and Casino. Opening its doors on October 7, 1952, it represented a pivotal moment in Las Vegas’s burgeoning casino era. As the sixth resort to grace the Strip, the Sahara, sprawling across 20 acres, quickly carved out its own distinct identity – a vibrant, themed oasis far removed from the dusty desert landscape. With 240 rooms, each boasting a patio or balcony, and a workforce of 500, it was a significant undertaking.

## The African Sahara Theme: An Exotic Touch

What truly set the Sahara apart was its audacious theme: the African Sahara. This wasn’t just a superficial paint job; the design permeated every aspect of the property. Think lush landscaping, faux desert [dunes](/posts/dunes-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), and elaborate décor evoking the romance and mystery of North Africa. The 85-foot-long bar, affectionately known as “The Long Bar,” became an instant landmark, drawing crowds eager for a cocktail and a glimpse of the lavish interior. Two restaurants catered to the growing clientele, adding to the resort’s allure. The presence of live entertainment, often including exotic dancers, further cemented its reputation as a sophisticated and exciting destination.

## Changing Hands, Enduring Spirit

The Sahara experienced several changes in ownership throughout its nearly six decades of operation. Notable figures like Milton Prell and Sheldon Adelson (who rebranded it as the [Desert Inn](/posts/desert-inn-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) briefly) were associated with the property, each leaving their mark on its evolution. While the theme was occasionally tweaked, the core essence of the Sahara—its commitment to spectacle and entertainment—remained constant. It became a beloved institution for locals and tourists alike.

## A Final Farewell & A Lasting Legacy

Sadly, the original Sahara closed its doors on May 16, 2011, after 58 years of operation, marking the end of an era. A massive liquidation sale followed, a bittersweet event for Las Vegas history enthusiasts. Hundreds of thousands of items were snapped up by collectors and bargain hunters, a poignant reminder of the resort’s impact. The iconic camel sign, a symbol synonymous with the Sahara, found a new home at the Neon Museum, ensuring its legacy wouldn't be forgotten. While a new Sahara Hotel and Casino now occupies the site, opening in 2019, it’s a completely separate entity. The memory of the original Sahara – its exotic theme, its vibrant atmosphere, and its significant contribution to vintage Las Vegas – lives on in photographs, memories, and the artifacts lovingly preserved by those who remember its golden age.
