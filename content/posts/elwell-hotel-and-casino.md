# Remembering a Piece of Old Vegas: The Elwell Hotel and Casino

The Las Vegas Strip we know today is a landscape of constant evolution. Grand resorts rise, and even older establishments fall to make way for new ventures. Among the vanished landmarks, the Elwell Hotel and Casino holds a special place, representing an early chapter in Las Vegas’s remarkable story. Located at First and Carson Streets (now beneath a Golden Nugget parking garage), the Elwell wasn't a sprawling resort, but a vital part of the city’s burgeoning hospitality scene.

## A Family Legacy in the Desert

The story of the Elwell Hotel is intertwined with the story of early Las Vegas itself. William Elwell, along with his sisters Naomi Uptigrove and Doris Brown, inherited property from their father, one of the region’s pioneers. In 1946, they began planning the construction of a hotel, and finally opened its doors to the public in 1951. This wasn't just a business venture; it was a continuation of a family's deep roots in the community. William Elwell was a prominent figure, serving as a University of Nevada regent and Las Vegas city commissioner – positions that showcased his dedication to the city's growth.

## A Small Hotel with Big Significance

Initially, the Elwell offered a modest number of rooms, but its location made it appealing to visitors. While not directly on the main Strip, it was close enough to benefit from the increasing tourist traffic.  The hotel exemplified the post-war boom in Las Vegas; a time when the desert town was rapidly transforming into an entertainment destination. In 1954, the Elwell saw a significant expansion, increasing its room count to 117. This expansion reflected the growing demand and signaled the Elwell’s success.

## From Elwell to Pioneer: A Change of Ownership

Sadly, William Elwell passed away in 1963. Just two years later, in 1965, the hotel was sold to the Pioneer Club for $1.5 million. Under the Pioneer’s ownership, the hotel underwent a name change, becoming simply the Pioneer Hotel. While the Elwell name disappeared, the building continued to serve as a downtown landmark for many years.

## A Lost Memory Beneath the Asphalt

In 1984, the inevitable happened. The Golden Nugget, always looking to expand and streamline its property, purchased the Pioneer Hotel and, regrettably, demolished it. The site now houses a parking garage - a stark contrast to the vibrant hotel that once stood there. While only photographs and memories remain, the Elwell Hotel and Casino serves as a poignant reminder of a different era in Las Vegas, a time when family businesses and modest hotels played a crucial role in shaping the city's unique character. The Elwell’s legacy lives on as a piece of Las Vegas history, a forgotten story beneath the concrete.
