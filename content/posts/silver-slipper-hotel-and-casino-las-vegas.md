## A Step Back in Time: The Silver Slipper's Debut

The Las Vegas Strip wasn’t always the glittering spectacle we know today. In the early 1950s, it was a landscape of ambitious dreams and fledgling casinos, all vying for a piece of the burgeoning gambling pie. One such dream materialized on September 1, 1950, with the opening of the Silver Slipper Hotel and Casino. Situated conveniently near [the Frontier Hotel and Casino](/posts/the-frontier-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), the Silver Slipper quickly carved out its own niche. Interestingly, while both properties initially shared the same ownership, the Silver Slipper’s gaming operations were eventually leased out, a common practice in the developing Las Vegas business world.

## The Iconic Neon Slipper

But what truly set the Silver Slipper apart wasn't its gaming, but its mesmerizing visual signature: a giant, rotating neon slipper. This wasn't just any slipper; it was a towering 12-foot marvel, sparkling with over 900 bulbs and dominating the North Las Vegas Boulevard landscape. The sight of the giant slipper slowly rotating was an instantly recognizable symbol of the Strip for years, attracting visitors and becoming synonymous with the playful, somewhat kitschy charm of early Las Vegas.  Today, that iconic slipper continues to shine, reborn and preserved at the Las Vegas Neon Museum, a vital reminder of a bygone era.

## Hughes’ Influence and a Slow Decline

The Silver Slipper's history took an unexpected turn in 1968 when it was leased from the owners by Howard Hughes. Hughes, the reclusive billionaire and entertainment mogul, held the lease until his death in 1976.  His involvement, while brief, speaks to the property's relative importance and potential at the time. After Hughes relinquished the lease, the casino struggled to maintain its former luster as the Strip underwent rapid modernization and expansion. Newer, larger, and more themed resorts began to eclipse the older establishments. 

## Closure and Legacy

Sadly, the Silver Slipper’s run came to an end on November 28, 1988.  The once-bustling casino was demolished to make way for a much-needed parking lot for the [Frontier](/posts/frontier-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/). Plans were floated to rebuild the Silver Slipper, capitalizing on its nostalgic appeal, but these ultimately never materialized. Now, the site sits vacant, a stark reminder of what once was – directly across from the dazzling Encore Hotel Casino. While the physical building is gone, the memory of the Silver Slipper and its shimmering neon slipper lives on, a cherished piece of vintage Las Vegas history and a testament to the city’s ever-evolving story.
