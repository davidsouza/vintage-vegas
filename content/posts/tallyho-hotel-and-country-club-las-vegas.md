## A Bold Experiment on the Strip

The Las Vegas Strip has always been synonymous with gambling, bright lights, and non-stop entertainment. But in December 1962, Edwin S. Lowe, a name familiar to many through his contributions to popular games like Bingo and Yahtzee, dared to dream of something different. He envisioned a luxury retreat, a haven of tranquility *without* the clatter of slot machines – the Tallyho Hotel and Country Club. Positioned directly across from the iconic [Dunes](/posts/dunes-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Hotel, the Tallyho was an audacious experiment, a "country club" atmosphere plopped down in the heart of the burgeoning Las Vegas Strip.

## Tudor Charm & Unique Amenities

The Tallyho's design was as distinctive as its concept. Built in the English Tudor style, it presented a stark contrast to the emerging modern aesthetic taking hold elsewhere on the Strip. The sprawling property, boasting 450 rooms and 32 villas, offered guests a level of luxury rarely seen at the time. Beyond the comfortable accommodations, the Tallyho catered to a discerning clientele with six restaurants, a swimming pool, horseback riding, bicycle rentals, and even helicopter service. Most remarkably, it featured a nine-hole pitch-and-putt golf course – an incredibly unusual amenity for a hotel so close to the Strip.  The grand opening promotion in February 1963 initially showed promise, but the writing was already on the wall.

## The Fatal Flaw: No Casino

The simple truth was, Las Vegas in the early 1960s ran on gambling. Visitors flocked to the city *for* the casinos, and the revenue generated by those establishments supported everything else. The absence of a casino at the Tallyho proved to be a fatal misstep. Lowe, acknowledging his error, publicly admitted it was a mistake not to include gambling.  Just eight months after opening, on October 10, 1963, the Tallyho Hotel and Country Club closed its doors, leaving over 100 employees out of work.

## Brief Reincarnations & Rumors

The property didn’t stay dark for long. Kings Crown Inns of America quickly acquired it, renaming it the King’s Crown Tallyho and attempting to add a casino and showroom.  This venture, however, was plagued by financial troubles and rumors of mob involvement – whispers of Jimmy “The Weasel” Fratianno having a stake in the operation swirled around the property.  After a brief, unsuccessful run, the King's Crown Tallyho shut down again in April 1965.

## From Tudor to Arabian Nights & Beyond

The Tallyho’s true transformation came in early 1966 when hotel magnate Milton Prell purchased the land. Prell commissioned architect Martin Stern Jr. to completely reimagine the Tudor estate into something new: the Arabian-themed [Aladdin](/posts/aladdin-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), which debuted on April 1, 1966. While the Aladdin proved successful, the original Tallyho structures were eventually demolished in 1998 to make way for a more modern resort. Today, the site is occupied by Planet Hollywood, a testament to the ever-evolving nature of the Las Vegas Strip.  The Tallyho, though short-lived, remains a fascinating footnote in Las Vegas history - a reminder that even in the entertainment capital of the world, unconventional ideas can sometimes fall victim to the relentless pull of the house edge.
