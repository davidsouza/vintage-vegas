# A Luxurious Gamble That Didn't Pay Off: The Tallyho Hotel and Country Club

The Las Vegas Strip is known for extravagance, innovation, and, above all, gambling. But in December 1962, a bold experiment challenged that very formula. Enter the Tallyho Hotel and Country Club, a luxury retreat unlike anything seen before (or since) on the Strip.

## Edwin Lowe's Vision: A Non-Gaming Oasis

The mastermind behind this unusual venture was Edwin S. Lowe, a name familiar to many for his role in popularizing Bingo and launching the iconic game Yahtzee. Lowe envisioned a sophisticated, non-gaming escape, a European-style country club experience transplanted to the Nevada desert. Situated directly across from the legendary Dunes Hotel, the Tallyho’s English Tudor architecture stood in stark contrast to the burgeoning modern aesthetic that was beginning to define the Strip.

The grand opening on Christmas Eve, 1962, was lavish. 450 rooms and 32 villas promised opulent comfort. Guests could enjoy six different restaurants, a swimming pool, horseback riding, bicycle rentals, and even helicopter service. The real head-turner? A nine-hole pitch-and-putt golf course – a remarkably unique amenity for a Las Vegas resort.

## The Fatal Flaw: No Casinos

Despite its elegance and novelty, the Tallyho's fatal flaw was its lack of a casino. In 1960s Las Vegas, gambling was the lifeblood of the city's economy. Visitors flocked to the Strip specifically for the thrill of the tables and the excitement of the slot machines. While the initial grand opening promotion in February 1963 reported respectable business, it wasn’t enough to sustain the property. Lowe, reluctantly, admitted his mistake.

The Tallyho’s doors closed abruptly on October 10, 1963, leaving over 100 employees out of work. It was a swift and dramatic end for a hotel that had barely lived.

## Shifting Ownership and Rumors

Following the closure, Kings Crown Inns of America acquired the property for a reported $7 million, rebranding it as the King’s Crown Tallyho. Plans were drawn up for a casino and showroom, but ultimately fell through, reportedly due to insufficient financing. The hotel shuttered again in April 1965. This period was also rife with rumors, with whispers connecting the project to mob figures, including Jimmy “The Weasel” Fratianno. These allegations, though never substantiated, added another layer of intrigue to the Tallyho’s short history.

## A Transformation and a Demolition

The property’s ultimate fate arrived in early 1966 when hotel-casino mogul Milton Prell purchased the land. Prell commissioned architect Martin Stern Jr. to transform the Tudor buildings into a vibrant Arabian-themed resort: the Aladdin. Opened on April 1, 1966, the Aladdin embraced the Las Vegas tradition of gambling and entertainment, a stark contrast to the Tallyho’s original vision. While the Aladdin itself underwent several renamings and expansions, the original Tallyho structures were finally demolished in 1998, making way for a modern resort. 

Today, the site is home to Planet Hollywood, a far cry from the quiet elegance of the Tallyho. The Tallyho Hotel and Country Club remains a fascinating footnote in Las Vegas history: a luxurious gamble that, despite its promise, simply couldn’t survive in a city built on the allure of the casino.
