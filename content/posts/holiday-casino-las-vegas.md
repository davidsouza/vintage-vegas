## From River Queen to Holiday Casino: A Steamboat Arrives on the Strip

The Las Vegas Strip has seen countless transformations over the decades, but the story of the Holiday Casino is particularly fascinating. Opening its doors on July 2, 1973, the casino didn't simply appear – it replaced the Tumbleweed and Pyramids motels, demonstrating the rapid evolution of the Strip in the early 70s. Originally planned as “River Queen,” the name change reflected the ambitious, playful theme envisioned by Shelby and Claudine Williams. They, previously successful owners of the Silver Slipper casino, wanted to cater to the everyday gambler, providing a fun and approachable atmosphere distinct from the high-roller havens. 

The adjacent Holiday Inn Center Strip hotel launched in 1972, paving the way for the casino and solidifying the partnership between Holiday Queen Land Corporation and Holiday Inn. The riverboat concept – complete with paddlewheels, smokestacks, and a façade that truly resembled a grand Mississippi steamboat – was instantly recognizable and helped the casino carve out a unique niche. It wasn't just about gambling; it was about entertainment and creating a memorable experience.

## Shelby’s Vision and Claudine’s Leadership

Shelby Williams’s leadership proved remarkably impactful, propelling the Holiday Casino to success at a pace rarely seen in the competitive Vegas landscape. Within two years, the casino was performing at a level that typically took rivals five years to achieve. Tragically, Shelby’s life was cut short in 1977.  This is when Claudine Williams stepped up, becoming one of the very few women to lead a Las Vegas casino – a significant feat in a notoriously male-dominated industry. Her leadership ensured the casino’s continued success and growth.

The 1980s brought expansion, with Holiday Inn increasing its stake until it ultimately gained full control in 1983 while retaining Claudine's vital role as chairperson. A massive 23-story tower in 1982 expanded the hotel’s capacity, making it the world’s largest Holiday Inn at the time.  The casino itself received a dramatic facelift around the same time, doubling down on the riverboat aesthetic with an impressive 80-foot paddlewheel and towering 85-foot smokestacks.  A further 35-story tower in 1989 pushed the total room count to an astounding 1,725.

## A Carnival Transformation and Legacy

In 1992, the Holiday Casino was absorbed into Harrah’s Entertainment (then the gaming arm of Holiday Inn), rebranding as Harrah’s Las Vegas. While the riverboat theme was a beloved feature, it wasn't meant to last forever. A massive $200 million renovation in 1997 saw the casino undergo a radical transformation into a vibrant Mardi Gras carnival theme, complete with six enormous, gold-leaf-plated jester sculptures. 

Although the original riverboat charm is now a memory, the Holiday Casino, now Harrah's Las Vegas, remains a landmark on the Strip. It stands as a testament to the changing face of Las Vegas, showcasing a transition from playful riverboat themes to elaborate carnival entertainment, and highlighting the enduring spirit of innovation and spectacle that defines the city.
