# A Steamboat on the Strip: The Birth of the Holiday Casino

The Las Vegas Strip has seen countless transformations, but few stories are as charmingly unique as that of the Holiday Casino. Opened on July 2, 1973, it wasn't just another casino; it was a bold attempt to capture the romance of the Mississippi River in the heart of the desert. Initially planned as the 'River Queen,' the casino, developed by Holiday Queen Land Corporation in partnership with Holiday Inn, offered a refreshing alternative to the increasingly opulent and exclusive casinos that were becoming the norm. Shelby and Claudine Williams, owners of the [Silver Slipper](/posts/silver-slipper-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), envisioned a place for everyday gamblers, and their vision paid off handsomely. The adjacent Holiday Inn Center Strip hotel, opening in 1972, laid the groundwork, creating a convenient and accessible destination.

## The Riverboat Era & Shelby Williams’s Touch

The Holiday Casino’s steamboat theme was instantly recognizable – towering smokestacks, massive paddlewheels, and a façade designed to transport guests to the banks of the mighty Mississippi. This playful aesthetic set it apart and helped it carve out a loyal following. Shelby Williams proved to be a remarkably effective leader. He seemingly compressed five years of growth into just two, establishing the casino as a Strip staple. Tragically, his life was cut short in 1977.

## Claudine Williams: A Pioneer for Women in Gaming

Following Shelby's death, Claudine Williams stepped up, becoming one of the first female casino leaders on the Las Vegas Strip. This was a significant moment in a historically male-dominated industry, showcasing her business acumen and resilience.  Holiday Inn’s increasing involvement culminated in full ownership by 1983, but Claudine remained as chairperson, retaining a significant influence over the property. The early 1980s also saw significant expansion, with a 23-story tower adding 494 rooms and boosting the total to a record-breaking 991 rooms, making it the world’s largest Holiday Inn at the time.  The casino itself was renovated further, amplifying the riverboat theme with an even more impressive 80-foot [paddlewheel](/posts/paddlewheel-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) and 85-foot smokestacks.

## From Riverboat to Revelry: The Mardi Gras Transformation

The late 1980s brought another expansion, with a 35-story tower adding 734 rooms, bringing the total accommodations to 1,725. But the most dramatic change came in 1992 when the casino was rebranded as Harrah’s Las Vegas. While the Harrah’s name signifies a new era, the original riverboat theme lingered until 1997. That year marked a radical stylistic shift, with a $200 million overhaul transforming the casino into a vibrant Mardi Gras celebration – complete with six gigantic, gold-leaf-plated jester sculptures.

## Legacy & Reflection

Though the original Holiday Casino’s riverboat charm is long gone, its legacy remains. It was a casino that prioritized accessibility and entertainment for a broader audience, and Claudine Williams's leadership paved the way for future female executives in the gaming industry. Today, Harrah's Las Vegas stands as a testament to the ever-changing landscape of the Las Vegas Strip, forever holding a place in vintage Vegas history as the beloved Holiday Casino.
