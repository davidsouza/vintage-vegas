## From Sundance to Shenanigans: The Early Years

301 Fremont Street, now home to The D Las Vegas, holds a fascinating history rooted firmly in the evolution of downtown Las Vegas. Before it was Fitzgeralds, the towering structure began life as the Sundance Hotel in 1980. A project of Moe Dalitz, alongside Al Sachs and Herb Tobman (the same folks behind the Stardust and Fremont casinos), the Sundance initially aimed to provide a solid, dependable option in a burgeoning downtown scene. It was quickly recognizable, its height setting it apart from the shorter, older buildings lining Fremont Street.

## Embracing the Irish Spirit: The Fitzgeralds Era

The real character arrived in 1987 when Lincoln Management Group/Fitzgeralds Gaming purchased the Sundance and gave it a radical transformation. Rebranded as Fitzgeralds Las Vegas, the property wholeheartedly embraced an Irish theme. Think shamrocks plastered everywhere, vibrant green trim, and a cheerful cartoon leprechaun mascot plastered on marketing materials – a delightfully quirky contrast to the glitzier, more sophisticated casinos popping up on the Strip. This branding cemented Fitzgeralds' reputation as a fun, value-oriented destination, perfect for those seeking a lively atmosphere without the premium price tag. The 42,000-square-foot casino offered a variety of games, a popular sportsbook, and multiple dining options, including a renowned buffet and steakhouse that drew in locals and tourists alike. The hotel rooms, particularly those on the higher floors, offered spectacular panoramic views of the Fremont Street Experience and the dazzling neon lights.

## A Milestone and a Revival: Barden's Impact

In a significant moment for Las Vegas history, Fitzgeralds was sold in 2001 to Don Barden, marking his entry as the first African American casino owner in Las Vegas. Barden invested heavily in renovations, a much-needed boost after the parent company’s bankruptcy. The exterior was repainted, the buffet and steakhouse received makeovers, and the showroom was upgraded, injecting new life into the property. It was a testament to Barden’s vision and a crucial step in keeping Fitzgeralds relevant in a changing landscape.

## The Final Chapter & Lasting Legacy

Following Barden's passing, the Stevens brothers (already owners of the Golden Gate) acquired Fitzgeralds in 2011. Their $22 million renovation modernized the casino floor, rooms, and exterior. While the Irish theming was retired, the core structure and casino footprint remained. In 2012, the property officially became The D Las Vegas. While the green shamrocks are gone, Fitzgeralds' legacy lives on. For many longtime Las Vegas visitors and residents, it represents a quintessential era of downtown – a time of accessible gaming, playful theming, and a recognizable, towering landmark watching over Fremont Street. The bones of Fitzgeralds remain, a constant reminder of a unique and vibrant chapter in Las Vegas history.
