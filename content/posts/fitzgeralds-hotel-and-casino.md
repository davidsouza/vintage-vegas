# A [Lucky](/posts/lucky-casino-las-vegas/) Charm on Fremont Street

For decades, a towering green and shamrock-laden presence graced the eastern end of Fremont Street: Fitzgeralds Hotel & Casino. More than just a casino, Fitzgeralds represented a distinct era of downtown Las Vegas – one of approachable gaming, quirky theming, and a vibrant, energetic atmosphere. Today, it lives on as The D Las Vegas, but the memories of its former identity remain strong with many long-time Vegas visitors.

## From [Sundance](/posts/sundance-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) to Shamrock

The story doesn’t begin with Fitzgeralds. Initially opened in 1980 as the Sundance Hotel, the property was a joint venture of Moe Dalitz, a prominent figure in Las Vegas development, and operators Al Sachs and Herb Tobman, who also held interests in the [Stardust](/posts/stardust-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) and Fremont casinos. However, its transformation into Fitzgeralds in 1987 marked a pivotal shift. Acquired by Lincoln Management Group / Fitzgeralds Gaming, the Sundance received a full rebranding, embracing a decidedly Irish theme. Think cartoon leprechauns, shamrock accents, and a welcoming, value-oriented atmosphere – a direct contrast to the increasingly opulent Strip resorts.

## The Fitzgeralds Experience

Fitzgeralds offered a classic Las Vegas experience. The 42,000-square-foot casino buzzed with activity, boasting a wide selection of slots, table games, keno, and a bustling sportsbook.  Its restaurants were popular draws; the buffet was a longtime favorite, and the steakhouse provided a more upscale dining option. Beyond the gaming, the 34-story tower provided incredible views of the Fremont Street Experience, especially after the canopy’s installation. It was a visible landmark that captured the fun and charm of downtown.

## Ownership Changes and a Momentous Milestone

The early 2000s brought upheaval when Fitzgeralds Gaming faced bankruptcy and the property was sold to Don Barden’s Majestic Star Casino LLC in 2001. This marked a historic moment, as Barden became the first African American casino owner in Las Vegas, an achievement recognized nationally. Barden invested significantly in the property, refreshing its exterior, renovating the buffet and steakhouse, and updating the showroom. This revitalization helped stabilize the property during a challenging time.

## A Final Farewell & A New Beginning

Following Barden’s passing, the Stevens brothers, who already owned the [Golden Gate](/posts/golden-gate-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), acquired Fitzgeralds in 2011. A $22 million renovation followed, modernizing the casino, hotel rooms, and street frontage. In 2012, the Fitzgeralds name was retired, and the property was reborn as The D Las Vegas. While the iconic Irish theme disappeared, the core structure and footprint remain.  Fitzgeralds lives on in memory and the architectural bones of The D, a testament to a classic era of downtown Las Vegas and a reminder of a lucky charm that once watched over Fremont Street.
