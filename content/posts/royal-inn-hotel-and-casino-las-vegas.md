## A Humble Beginning: The [Royal](/posts/royal-casino-las-vegas/) Inn Joins the Strip Landscape

Before the mega-resorts and sprawling complexes dominated the Las Vegas Strip, smaller, more intimate hotels dotted the landscape. One such property was the Royal Inn Hotel and Casino, a 12-story, 200-room establishment that opened its doors on April 19, 1970, just east of the main action. Costing $3 million to build, it was part of the Royal Inns of America chain, a popular motel brand at the time. Though relatively small by Vegas standards even then, the Royal Inn offered a comfortable and affordable option for visitors, signaling a period of expansion beyond the iconic downtown casinos.

## A Period of Management and Transition

The early 1970s saw the Royal Inn under the management of Michael Gaughan, a name synonymous with Las Vegas casino history, and Frank Toti. Their stewardship helped navigate the casino through a rapidly changing landscape. In 1979, Horn & Hardart, a well-known food service company, acquired the Royal Inn for a significant $17 million. This acquisition marked a dramatic shift in direction. Horn & Hardart, seeking to reposition the property, rebranded it as the Royal Americana Hotel in late 1980, aiming for a more family-friendly and Americana-themed appeal.

## Short-Lived Rebrand and Sudden Closure

Unfortunately, the Royal Americana experiment proved unsuccessful. Facing mounting losses, Horn & Hardart made the difficult decision to shutter the entire hotel in 1982. While the hotel closed its doors, the casino portion remained open, albeit with limited gaming options, crucial for maintaining the valuable gaming license.

## The Paddlewheel Era and Beyond

Following a remodel, the property was resurrected in 1983 under a new identity: the [Paddlewheel Hotel and Casino](/posts/paddlewheel-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/). The name evoked a classic riverboat casino theme, attempting to draw in a new clientele. However, the Paddlewheel’s time was short-lived as well.

The site has remained vacant since the Paddlewheel’s eventual closure. Now owned by developer Lorenzo Doumani, it sits as a blank canvas awaiting its next chapter. Doumani's ambitious plan for a non-gaming high-rise, Majestic Las Vegas, has faced numerous setbacks and delays, leaving the land a constant reminder of the past transformations. The Royal Inn/Royal Americana/Paddlewheel story encapsulates a pivotal era in Las Vegas, highlighting the evolution of the Strip and the challenges of adapting to a fiercely competitive market. While the buildings are gone, the memory of this once-familiar landmark lives on in vintage Las Vegas lore.
