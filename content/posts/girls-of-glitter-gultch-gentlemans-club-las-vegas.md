## From [Golden Goose](/posts/golden-goose-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) to Girls of [Glitter Gulch](/posts/glitter-gulch-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/): A Fremont Street Evolution

Fremont Street, long before the glittering Viva Vision canopy, held a different kind of spectacle. It was a raw, vibrant, and sometimes rough-around-the-edges playground for Las Vegas. And nestled within that scene was a key player in the city's adult entertainment landscape: Girls of Glitter Gulch. But understanding its story means digging back into the history of its predecessors.

The tale begins in 1975 with the Golden Goose. This wasn’t your average casino-hotel. It was a quirky, low-key establishment known for its relaxed atmosphere and, crucially, its topless entertainment. Next door, in 1980, Bob Stupak opened Glitter Gulch, aiming for a flashier, more opulent feel. Glitter Gulch, ironically named for an early Las Vegas mining area, quickly became a landmark with its cascading waterfall and glitzy décor.  While offering casino games and restaurants, Glitter Gulch also incorporated elements of adult entertainment, recognizing the demand and profitability of the genre.

## The Merger & The Girls

The early 1990s saw a significant shift. In 1991, recognizing the potential of combining forces, Glitter Gulch and the Golden Goose merged to create Girls of Glitter Gulch. The new club embraced the legacy of both predecessors – the Golden Goose’s established clientele and the Glitter Gulch’s commitment to a premium experience. It quickly became a beloved, albeit notorious, institution on Fremont Street.  The "Girls of Glitter Gulch" became synonymous with the area's playful, unapologetic, and sometimes outrageous spirit. Performers were, by many accounts, given a level of respect and autonomy unusual in the industry at the time.

## A Las Vegas Icon Until 2016

For over two decades, Girls of Glitter Gulch operated as a cornerstone of Fremont Street's entertainment district. It represented a specific era – a time when Vegas was still shedding its family-friendly image and fully embracing its reputation as Sin City. The club's exterior was iconic, its neon signs blinking amidst the classic Fremont Street atmosphere. Inside, it offered a spectacle that, while catering to a specific audience, was undeniably part of Las Vegas’s unique character. 

## From Glitter to Concrete: A Legacy of Change

Sadly, the show came to an end in 2016 when Girls of Glitter Gulch closed its doors. In 2017, the building was demolished to make way for the massive Circa Resort and Casino, a project reflecting a modern Las Vegas. While the neon and the dancers are gone, the memory of Girls of Glitter Gulch lives on in the stories and photographs of vintage Las Vegas, a reminder of a time when Fremont Street was a little wilder, a little more eccentric, and a lot more… Glitter Gulch. The site may now house a different kind of entertainment, but it still carries echoes of the women and the times that made Girls of Glitter Gulch a true Las Vegas original.
