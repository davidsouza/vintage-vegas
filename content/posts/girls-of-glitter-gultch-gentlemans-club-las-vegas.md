## From [Golden Goose](/posts/golden-goose-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) to Girls of [Glitter Gulch](/posts/glitter-gulch-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/): A Fremont Street Story

The Fremont Street Experience is a vibrant spectacle today, but it wasn’t always so polished. For decades, the area, once known as “Glitter Gulch,” thrived on a different kind of energy – a raucous, adult-oriented atmosphere fueled by iconic (and sometimes scandalous) establishments. Among these was Girls of Glitter Gulch, a gentlemen’s club that holds a unique place in Las Vegas history.

## The Roots: Glitter Gulch & The Golden Goose

The story begins in the mid-1970s. In 1975, Bill Moran and partners opened the Golden Goose, a popular adult entertainment venue on Fremont Street. It was a classic Vegas dive, known for its lively atmosphere and – importantly – its proximity to the ambitious development next door. That development was Bob Stupak’s Glitter Gulch, which opened in 1980, a sprawling complex aiming to revitalize the struggling Fremont Street. Glitter Gulch was a gamble – a large-scale project that initially faced challenges but ultimately helped to reinvigorate the area, despite its financial struggles.

## A Merger and a Name

The two clubs, located practically side-by-side, were natural competitors. Recognizing an opportunity, in 1991, they merged, creating what became known as Girls of Glitter Gulch. The new name cleverly combined the legacy of both predecessors, signifying a powerhouse adult entertainment destination. The club quickly became a Fremont Street staple, known for its lively performances and a clientele seeking a distinctly Vegas experience. It became more than just a club; it was a symbol of the area’s unapologetic and often boisterous character. It was a place where stories were made and legends were born (and perhaps, forgotten the next morning).

## The Demise and a New Dawn

Despite its popularity and enduring legacy, Girls of Glitter Gulch couldn’t withstand the changing tides of Las Vegas. The adult entertainment landscape shifted, and the club eventually closed its doors in 2016. Sadly, it was demolished in 2017, making way for a new generation of Vegas entertainment. Today, the site is home to Circa Resort & Casino, a modern gaming and entertainment complex, marking a stark contrast to the club’s former glory. 

## A Legacy in the Glitter Gulch Dust

While Girls of Glitter Gulch is gone, its memory lives on within the lore of vintage Las Vegas. It represents a specific era – one of unapologetic fun, a slightly grittier feel, and a commitment to providing a unique experience. The club’s existence encapsulates a fascinating chapter in Fremont Street’s history, a reminder of a time when Glitter Gulch truly lived up to its name.
