## A Peek into a Forgotten Fremont Street

Downtown Las Vegas, particularly Fremont Street, has always been about reinvention. But even amidst the constant evolution, remembering the smaller, quirkier establishments that paved the way is essential to understanding the Strip’s rich history. One such gem, though fleeting, was the Keyhole Bar. Nestled within the Sal Sagev Hotel (later becoming part of the Golden Gate) at 13 Fremont Street, the Keyhole Bar operated for a brief but memorable period roughly between 1953 and 1955.

## The Branding That Defined It

What truly set the Keyhole Bar apart wasn’t its size – it was remarkably small, tucked into a narrow space between other businesses – but its playful branding. The name itself was perfectly reflected in the bar’s defining feature: a keyhole-shaped front door. This unique shape was echoed in its vibrant neon sign and even on matchbooks, creating an instantly recognizable and delightfully literal touch in the bustling landscape of Fremont Street.  Imagine the scene: a canyon of competing neon signs, all vying for attention, and then this small, cleverly branded entrance beckoning passersby. It was pure vintage Las Vegas charm. 

## A Local's Haven

Inside, the Keyhole Bar epitomized the classic mid-century Vegas watering hole. Contemporary accounts describe an intimate, smoky atmosphere, a stark contrast to the grand casino floors of the larger establishments. It wasn't designed for the high rollers. Instead, it catered to locals, casino workers, and adventurous tourists looking for something different – a taste of authentic Vegas life. While detailed descriptions of the interior are scarce, it’s safe to assume it was a typical 1950s lounge, likely with a few slot machines and perhaps a game of 21 alongside the bar. Fremont Street at that time allowed smaller businesses to incorporate gambling, a feature that further cemented the Keyhole’s appeal.

## A Short Run, A Lasting Impression

Sadly, the Keyhole Bar's run was short-lived. By 1955, the name disappeared, replaced by the Lucky 13 Club, still at its original location. The Lucky 13 continued operation for a couple of years, limited to slot machines and 21, before eventually succumbing to the ever-changing landscape of downtown Las Vegas. 

The site itself, for decades, maintained a visible alleyway adjacent to the frontage – a ghostly reminder of the Keyhole Bar's original placement. However, with the Golden Gate’s significant 2017 expansion, even this vestige vanished, effectively erasing the last tangible link to the little bar.

## Remembering a Vegas Icon 

Though it existed for just a few years, the Keyhole Bar remains a significant piece of Fremont Street's history. It represents a bygone era, a time when small, personality-driven businesses could thrive alongside the burgeoning casino industry. Its memory lives on in vintage photographs, those iconic matchbooks, and the enduring fascination with Fremont Street's formative years – a testament to the power of clever branding and a uniquely Vegas spirit.
