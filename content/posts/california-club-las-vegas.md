## A Downtown Institution: The California Club's Early Days

The landscape of Las Vegas has changed dramatically over the decades, but remembering the casinos that paved the way is vital to understanding its evolution.  The California Club, situated at 101 East Fremont Street, holds a special place in that history. Opening in the early 1950s, it wasn't a glittering Strip behemoth. Instead, the California Club embodied the burgeoning downtown Las Vegas vibe: friendly, accessible, and geared towards locals and the working class.  Originally owned by Phil Copley, and later Phil Long, the club quickly became a fixture on Fremont Street, a welcome respite from the increasingly extravagant Strip resorts that were starting to emerge. Its unassuming scale contrasted sharply with the glitz being built just a few blocks away.

## The Bear and the Friendly Atmosphere

The California Club was instantly recognizable thanks to its distinctive bear mascot logo. This image, combined with a focus on approachable gaming – think classic table games and straightforward slot machines – fostered a loyal clientele. Unlike the newer casinos trying to draw high-rollers, the California Club prioritized welcoming service and a comfortable environment.  It was the kind of place where regulars felt like family, and where a casual player could enjoy a few rounds without feeling intimidated.  This “locals-first” philosophy was a key ingredient in its early success.



## Frank Schivo and a Renewed Legacy

The club saw several ownership changes, but its most significant resurgence came in January 1967 when Frank Schivo, a respected figure in Las Vegas gaming, acquired it with partner Norbert Jansen. Renaming it “Frank Schivo’s California Club,” he injected new life into the property and reasserted its position in the downtown market. Schivo’s connections and vision ensured its continued operation, building upon the club's established reputation. Under his leadership, the California Club continued to serve as a cornerstone of the Fremont Street experience. 

## A Brief but Important Chapter

Sadly, the California Club's era of prominence was relatively short-lived. By 1970, the club had ceased operations, a victim of the increasingly competitive and rapidly changing Las Vegas casino landscape. The original lease at 101 Fremont was purchased by the Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino in February 1971, and the California Club’s individual identity slowly faded into history. Though its physical presence vanished, the spirit of the California Club lives on as a reminder of a simpler time in Las Vegas.



## Remembering a Downtown Classic

Today, the site of the California Club is part of the Golden Nugget Las Vegas complex, a testament to the city’s relentless growth. While the building itself is gone, the California Club represents an important chapter in vintage Las Vegas history—a testament to the entrepreneurial spirit and the unique community feel that defined downtown’s early years.  It's a reminder that the story of Las Vegas isn't just about the Strip, but also about the humble casinos that helped build its foundation.
