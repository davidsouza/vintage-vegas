## A Downtown Staple: The California Club's Early Days

For those of us who truly appreciate vintage Las Vegas, the name “California Club” evokes images of a simpler time on Fremont Street. Located at 101 East Fremont Street, this wasn’t one of the glitzy Strip mega-resorts; it was a cornerstone of the downtown “locals-first” casino scene, a place where friendly service and a welcoming atmosphere reigned supreme. The club first opened its doors in the early 1950s, initially under the ownership of Phil Copley and later Phil Long. Its logo, featuring a friendly bear mascot, became instantly recognizable to locals and visitors alike.

Unlike the opulent displays that would later define the Strip, the California Club focused on approachable table games and slots, catering to a crowd of downtown workers and casual gamblers. It wasn’t about the spectacle; it was about reliable entertainment and a sense of community. Think of it as a comforting constant amidst a rapidly changing city.

## Frank Schivo and a Renewed Vision

The California Club experienced another significant chapter when Frank Schivo, a prominent figure in Las Vegas gaming, acquired the then-closed property in January 1967 alongside Norbert Jansen. They reopened it as “Frank Schivo’s California Club,” injecting new energy and his own network of connections into the business. Schivo’s involvement signaled a renewed commitment to the downtown market, attempting to recapture the original spirit of the club. This era added another layer to the California Club’s complex history, showcasing the constant evolution and competition within the downtown casino landscape.

## A Short but Significant Run

Sadly, the California Club’s run, regardless of its ownership, proved relatively short-lived. By around 1970, the club had closed its doors, becoming another casualty in the ever-changing face of Las Vegas. While the club itself disappeared, its legacy persevered. In February 1971, the lease at 101 Fremont was purchased by the Golden Nugget, effectively absorbing the California Club’s footprint into their growing empire. The original identity faded, but the memories remained.

## Legacy and Remembrance

Today, the California Club’s former location is part of the Golden Nugget Las Vegas complex, with the Nugget expanding onto the 101 Fremont parcel in 1983. Though the physical building is gone, the California Club serves as a powerful reminder of a bygone era – a time when downtown Las Vegas was the undisputed heart of the city’s entertainment scene. It stands as a testament to the entrepreneurial spirit, the importance of community, and the enduring appeal of a simpler, more welcoming style of gaming that defined vintage Las Vegas.
