## A Star is Born: The Stardust's Grand Entrance

The Las Vegas Strip wouldn't be what it is today without the Stardust Hotel and Casino. Opened on July 2, 1958, it was a behemoth. Imagine: 1,065 rooms, a sprawling 16,500 square foot casino, and a whopping 60 acres of land! It was, quite simply, the largest hotel in the world at the time. The story began with Tony Cornero, who initially spearheaded the project. Following his untimely death in 1955, his brother took over until Rella Factor finalized the deal and brought the Stardust to life. Its sheer scale set it apart, and its location – just south of the burgeoning center of the Strip – cemented its place in Las Vegas history.

## The '50s and '60s: Glamour, Country Clubs, and a Speedway

The Stardust quickly became synonymous with the glamorous Rat Pack era. It hosted iconic performers and attracted a sophisticated clientele. But the Stardust was more than just a casino and hotel. During the 1960s, it was an experience. The resort operated a private country club, catering to high rollers, and even had its own raceway, a testament to the ambitious scope of the ownership. Adding the Royal Nevada hotel-casino in 1959 further expanded its footprint. A nine-story addition in 1964 just proved its continued popularity and growth.

## Shadows and Scandals: The Dark Side of the Glitter

The Stardust’s story isn't all sparkle and song. In the 1970s and 80s, it became entangled in a series of investigations revealing organized crime involvement and, most disturbingly, skimming operations – illegally diverting casino profits. Ownership changed hands multiple times as a result, with Argent Corporation buying it in 1974 and then another sale in 1979. A 1983 investigation further confirmed ongoing illicit activities. These scandals, while damaging, became a somewhat infamous part of the Stardust’s legacy.

## A Final Chapter: Demise and Legacy

The Boyd family acquired the Stardust in 1985, and though they maintained the property for two decades, competition from newer, flashier resorts began to take its toll. By 2006, despite boasting an 85,000 square foot casino and 1,552 rooms, the Stardust struggled to remain competitive. Boyd Gaming announced its closure in January 2006, and on November 1, 2006, the curtain fell. The implosion in March 2007 was a sad moment for many who remembered the Stardust’s heyday. While the resort itself is gone, its iconic roadside sign now shines brightly at the Las Vegas Neon Museum, a constant reminder of a bygone era of vintage Las Vegas and the rise and fall of a true Strip legend. The site now houses Resorts World, but the spirit of the Stardust lingers in the memories of those who experienced its golden years.
