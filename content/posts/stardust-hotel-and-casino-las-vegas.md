## A Galaxy of Dreams: The Birth of the Stardust

The Stardust Hotel and Casino. Just the name conjures images of smoky casinos, dazzling lights, and a certain old-school Vegas charm. Built on a sprawling 60-acre plot on the Las Vegas Strip, the Stardust wasn’t just a hotel and casino – it was a statement.  Its story, beginning in 1954, is as glittering and complicated as the neon lights that illuminated its facade. The project’s initial visionary was Tony Cornero, an Italian immigrant with big ambitions. Sadly, Cornero's sudden death in 1955 left the project in the hands of his brother. While construction continued, the hotel's true destiny was solidified in 1958 when Rella Factor stepped in, completing the ambitious vision. The grand opening on July 2, 1958, marked a monumental moment: the Stardust was the largest hotel in the world, boasting a staggering 1,065 rooms and a vast 16,500 square foot casino floor. 

## The Golden Age & Beyond

The 1960s were a peak era for the Stardust. It wasn’t just about the size; it was about the vibe.  The Stardust attracted a different kind of clientele – a more casual, working-class crowd seeking entertainment and a gamble. It actively marketed itself as a place where anyone could feel welcome, a refreshing change from the more exclusive casinos that dotted the Strip. Think big-band music, affordable rooms, and a playful, space-age aesthetic.  Beyond the hotel, the Stardust expanded its empire with a country club and even a raceway, showcasing the ambition of its owners.  The 1959 addition of the [Royal Nevada](/posts/royal-nevada-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) hotel-casino further amplified its size. 

## Shadows and Scandals 

However, the Stardust's glittering exterior hid a darker side. While it thrived, the resort became embroiled in investigations concerning illegal activities. In 1976, a state investigation uncovered skimming operations – a blatant violation of the law. This led to a sale in 1979 and another damning investigation in 1983, confirming the continuing skimming. These issues cast a long shadow, though the resort’s popularity largely remained undiminished. In 1974, the Argent Corporation purchased the property, and the addition of a sportsbook in 1975 cemented its place as a Las Vegas staple. 

## A Final Curtain Call

The Boyd family acquired the Stardust in 1985, attempting to revitalize the property. While it expanded to a massive 85,000 square foot casino and 1,552 rooms, it increasingly struggled to compete with the increasingly lavish and modern resorts popping up around it.  Ultimately, on November 1, 2006, the Stardust closed its doors for the final time. The demolition in March 2007 was a painful moment for many longtime Las Vegas residents, marking the end of an era. Thankfully, the iconic Stardust sign found a new home at the Las Vegas Neon Museum, preserving a piece of its memory. Today, the land where the Stardust once stood is occupied by Resorts World, a testament to the constant evolution of the Las Vegas Strip.
