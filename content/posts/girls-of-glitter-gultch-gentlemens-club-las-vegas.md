## From Golden Goose to Girls of Glitter Gulch: A Fremont Street Evolution

The Fremont Street Experience is synonymous with old-school Vegas, but beneath the dazzling Viva Vision light show lies a rich and often-forgotten history. Today, Circa Resort & Casino stands proudly on Fremont Street, but before it rose from the desert dust, the land was home to a landmark in Vegas nightlife: Girls of Glitter Gulch, a gentlemen’s club with a story all its own.

The club’s origins aren’t as straightforward as its name suggests. It started with two separate entities: The Golden Goose, which opened its doors in 1975, and Bob Stupak’s Glitter Gulch, arriving in 1980. The Golden Goose was a classic, slightly rough-around-the-edges establishment that quickly built a loyal following. Glitter Gulch, built by the flamboyant Stupak (who also famously built the Stratosphere), was an ambitious project, attempting to bring a more upscale – though still undeniably Vegas – vibe to the Fremont Street scene.

## The Merger & the Magic of Girls of Glitter Gulch

In 1991, a significant shift occurred. Glitter Gulch and its neighbor, the Golden Goose, merged, creating the legendary Girls of Glitter Gulch. This fusion brought together the established clientele of the Goose with the ambition and slightly more extravagant feel of Stupak’s original club. The new entity quickly solidified its place as a cornerstone of Fremont Street's adult entertainment landscape. 

What made Girls of Glitter Gulch special? Beyond the usual trappings of a gentleman’s club, it was known for its vibrant atmosphere. The décor was a blend of kitsch and glitz, perfectly embodying the spirit of 1990s Las Vegas. Performances were lively and engaging, and the club fostered a sense of community among its patrons and staff. It was a place where you could feel the energy of old Vegas.

## A Demise and a New Beginning

Sadly, all eras eventually come to an end. Girls of Glitter Gulch closed its doors in 2016, marking the end of an era for Fremont Street. The building was demolished in 2017, making way for Derek Stevens’ ambitious Circa Resort & Casino, a project aiming to bring a new level of classic Vegas sophistication back to the area. 

While the neon sign of Girls of Glitter Gulch is gone, its legacy remains. It represents a crucial period in Las Vegas’s evolution – a time when Fremont Street was the undisputed heart of the city's entertainment scene, and where businesses like Girls of Glitter Gulch helped shape the unique character of Vintage Las Vegas.  It serves as a reminder of the vibrant and sometimes-unconventional history that lies beneath the surface of modern-day Las Vegas.
