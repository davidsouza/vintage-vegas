## More Than Just a Laundry: Steiner’s and the Vegas Elite

We often think of Las Vegas as dazzling lights, high-rolling gamblers, and world-class entertainment. But behind the curtain of the Las Vegas Strip's glamour lies a surprisingly humble story: the story of Steiner Cleaners and Laundry. Founded in the early 1960s by Herman Steiner, this unassuming establishment became a cornerstone of the city’s entertainment scene, quietly servicing the wardrobes of some of the biggest names in show business.

Steiner’s wasn’t just about pressing shirts and removing stains. It was about preserving the magic, quite literally, of Las Vegas's iconic performers. After Herman Steiner's initial years, the business truly blossomed under Vic Plassman, who started as an employee and eventually took over. Plassman earned the legendary title, “stain‑master of the stars,” a fitting description for someone responsible for keeping the costumes of Vegas's elite looking their absolute best.

## Rhinestones, Elvis, and the Art of Delicate Cleaning

Imagine the pressure: meticulously cleaning Liberace's capes, shimmering with thousands upon thousands of crystals—reportedly around 4,000 per cape! Each garment presented a unique challenge, demanding a level of expertise beyond your average dry cleaning. Elvis Presley, Robert Goulet, Jimmy “J.J.” Walker, Norm Crosby, Sandy Hackett, and Rhonda Shear were just a few of the other stars who trusted Steiner’s with their prized possessions. The commitment to top-tier garment care was unwavering, and that reputation became Steiner's key to success. It wasn’t just about removing stains; it was about preserving artistry.

## The “Happy Shirt” – A Neon Icon

Steiner's public image was undeniably brightened by its iconic “Happy Shirt” neon sign. Designed by Herman Steiner’s daughter and brought to life by YESCO in 1962, the sign featured animated waving arms, adding a whimsical touch to Tropicana Avenue. This playful display became synonymous with Steiner’s, further solidifying its place in the Vegas landscape. Thankfully, the sign wasn’t lost to time. It now stands proudly at the Neon Museum, a vibrant reminder of a bygone era.

## A Legacy of Quality and Craftsmanship

Though Steiner Cleaners permanently closed its doors, its legacy remains. The neon “Happy Shirt” continues to charm visitors at the Neon Museum, ensuring the business’s story is never forgotten. And while semi-retired, Vic Plassman occasionally still offers his expert cleaning services—a testament to the enduring value of quality craftsmanship. Steiner Cleaners & Laundry wasn't just a place to get your clothes cleaned; it was a vital, albeit often unsung, part of the Las Vegas entertainment mythos.
