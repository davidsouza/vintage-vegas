## Beyond the Spin Cycle: Steiner Cleaners and Vegas Glamour

Las Vegas. The name conjures images of dazzling lights, incredible performances, and, of course, legendary personalities. But behind the curtain of the Las Vegas Strip, a different kind of legend quietly operated: Steiner Cleaners and Laundry. Founded in the early 1960s by Herman Steiner, it wasn't just about clean clothes; it was about preserving the magic of Vegas’s golden age. While seemingly unassuming, Steiner’s became a vital backstage partner to the stars, earning the nickname "the stain-master of the stars."

## From Employee to Icon: Vic Plassman Takes the Helm

The real transformation of Steiner’s came with Vic Plassman. Beginning as an employee, Plassman eventually purchased the business and elevated it to a level of service and prestige that few could match. He understood that these weren't just garments; they were crucial components of elaborate stage presentations, often worth a small fortune. Plassman's expertise was paramount, especially when dealing with the intricate costumes of the Strip’s biggest names.

## Rhinestones, Royalty, and Relentless Care

Think Liberace’s opulent, rhinestone-studded capes. Each cape boasted around 4,000 crystals – a cleaning challenge bordering on the impossible! Plassman and his team meticulously cleaned and refurbished these masterpieces nightly, ensuring Liberace's shimmering presence remained flawless. But Liberace was just one client. Elvis Presley, Robert Goulet, Jimmy “J.J.” Walker, Norm Crosby, Sandy Hackett, and Rhonda Shear all entrusted Steiner's with their wardrobes.  The sheer volume and detail demanded an unparalleled level of care and attention, making Steiner's a vital (and often unsung) partner to the entertainment industry. Their dedication was so noteworthy that many performers happily voiced radio ads praising the service.

## The "Happy Shirt" - A Neon Landmark

Steiner's iconic status was solidified by its "Happy Shirt" neon sign. Designed by Herman Steiner’s daughter and expertly built by YESCO in 1962, the sign featured animated waving arms, bringing a touch of cheerful whimsy to [Tropicana](/posts/tropicana-country-club-las-vegas/) Avenue. It became a familiar landmark for both locals and visitors, symbolizing the playful and extravagant spirit of Las Vegas. The sign's eventual relocation to the Neon Museum ensured its preservation, now a treasured exhibit within the "Neon Boneyard."

## A Legacy that Endures

Though Steiner Cleaners permanently closed its doors, its legacy lives on. The "Happy Shirt" neon sign continues to delight visitors at the Neon Museum, a vibrant reminder of a bygone era. And, remarkably, Vic Plassman remains semi-retired, occasionally offering his expert cleaning services—a testament to the enduring value of craftsmanship and dedication. Steiner Cleaners wasn't just a laundry; it was a crucial piece of Las Vegas's entertainment history, a backstage secret whispered among the stars.
