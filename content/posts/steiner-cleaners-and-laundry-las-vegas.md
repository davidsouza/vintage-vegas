## More Than Just a Laundry: The Story of Steiner Cleaners and Laundry Las Vegas

When you think of Las Vegas, images of dazzling lights, elaborate shows, and legendary performers likely come to mind. But behind the glitz and glamour lies a network of businesses that quietly supported the entertainment machine. And few were as crucial – or as fascinating – as Steiner Cleaners and Laundry. Founded in the early 1960s by Herman Steiner, this seemingly ordinary establishment became an extraordinary fixture in the Las Vegas Strip's history.

Steiner Cleaners wasn’t just about cleaning clothes; it was about preserving the magic of the stage. Initially a standard dry cleaning service, the business’s trajectory changed dramatically under Vic Plassman, who started as an employee and eventually took over. Plassman cultivated a reputation as the “stain-master of the stars,” drawing in a clientele that included some of the biggest names in entertainment.

## Rhinestones, Elvis, and the Art of Garment Care

The secret to Steiner’s success lay in its meticulous attention to detail and its understanding of the unique needs of show business. These weren't your average stains! Plassman and his team routinely handled intricate costumes, often dealing with delicate fabrics, sequins, feathers, and, most famously, Liberace’s opulent, rhinestone-encrusted capes. Each cape boasted around 4,000 crystals – imagine the precision required to clean and maintain something like that nightly! Elvis Presley was another prominent client, along with a long list of other entertainers, including Robert Goulet, Jimmy "J.J." Walker, Norm Crosby, Sandy Hackett, and Rhonda Shear – all of whom enthusiastically endorsed Steiner’s in a series of memorable radio advertisements.

## The “Happy Shirt” and a Neon Legacy

Beyond its celebrity clientele, Steiner’s gained iconic status thanks to its vibrant “Happy Shirt” neon sign. Originally designed by Herman Steiner’s daughter and lovingly constructed by YESCO in 1962, the sign featured animated waving arms and became a beloved landmark on Tropicana Avenue. Thankfully, the sign's legacy lives on; it now shines brightly as a treasured exhibit at the Neon Museum, a testament to a bygone era of Las Vegas.

Steiner Cleaners officially closed its doors, but its story isn't over. Vic Plassman remains semi-retired, occasionally lending his expertise to garment care, a living reminder of the dedication and craftsmanship that defined Steiner’s. It wasn't simply a laundry; it was a crucial piece of the Las Vegas entertainment ecosystem, a backstage secret that helped keep the show – and the stars – sparkling.
