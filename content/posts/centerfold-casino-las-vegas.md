## A Quick Flip Through Vegas History: Centerfold Casino

The Las Vegas Strip has always been a place of reinvention, a canvas for bold ideas and even bolder marketing. And in 1975, Centerfold Casino made a *very* memorable [splash](/posts/splash-las-vegas/). Located at 2440 Las Vegas Boulevard South, a spot that has seen numerous iterations over the years (previously Honest John's Casino and home to the iconic Big Wheel), Centerfold represented a specific, and somewhat fleeting, moment in Las Vegas history. It wasn't about grandeur or elegance – it was about embracing the kitsch, pushing boundaries, and undeniably, attracting attention.

## The Neon Promise: Girls, Gambling, & Gimmicks

Centerfold's marketing was its calling card. The neon marquee screamed “Girls! Girls! Girls!” alongside promises of casino games and a lively atmosphere. While the implication was certainly suggestive – pointing towards topless entertainment – savvy operators knew the rules. Nevada’s Gaming Commission kept a tight leash on overt adult entertainment within casinos. The reality was likely that any performance aspects were carefully segregated from the actual gaming floor to stay compliant.  That didn’t stop the marketing from leaving a lasting impression, though. It perfectly encapsulated the era's edgy, adult-oriented entertainment landscape – a world where the lines between gambling and adult entertainment were deliberately blurred.

## A Year of Flash and Fizz

Despite its splashy entrance, Centerfold's reign was relatively short-lived. It operated for roughly a year, from 1975 to 1977, before transforming into the [Jolly Trolley](/posts/jolly-trolley-casino-las-vegas/), another adult-themed casino. The Jolly Trolley itself had a run until around 1981, further illustrating the rapid turnover of businesses along that particular stretch of the Strip.  These weren't casinos built to last; they were experiments in entertainment, attempting to capitalize on the booming tourism and a growing appetite for something a little… different.

## Beyond the Neon: A Legacy of Kitsch

The property’s story doesn’t end there, of course. It continued to evolve, eventually becoming the massive [Bonanza](/posts/bonanza-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Gift Shop complex – a quirky amalgamation of adult novelty items, souvenirs, and, in a bizarre twist, a bit of everything. This final iteration, while vastly different from the Centerfold, still reflects the area’s history of unusual attractions. 

Centerfold Casino, even in its brief existence, served as a marker of Las Vegas's willingness to embrace the provocative and the playful. It's a reminder of a time when the Strip felt truly wild, where the rules were constantly being tested, and where a little bit of cheeky marketing could go a long way.  Today, its legacy lives on in vintage photographs, faded neon signs, and the stories that continue to be told about a place that dared to be different – a testament to the unforgettable, sometimes bizarre, soul of vintage Las Vegas.
