## A Lush Oasis on the Strip

The Tropicana Hotel and Casino, affectionately nicknamed “The Trop” by locals, held a unique place in the history of the Las Vegas Strip. Opened on April 4, 1957, it represented a lavish investment – the most expensive resort in Las Vegas at the time. Built on a sprawling 35 acres, the 1,467-room hotel boasted a 44,570 square foot casino, offering a sense of spaciousness and luxury that distinguished it from its competitors. Its design, inspired by a Caribbean garden, created an immediate sense of escape – a tropical paradise in the Nevada desert. The initial intention was to create something distinct from the more modern, streamlined designs becoming popular, aiming for old-world charm and lush greenery.

## Glamour, Shows, and Shady Business

The Tropicana quickly established itself as a destination for entertainment. Most famously, it was the longtime home of the *Folies Bergère*, the longest-running show in Las Vegas history. This spectacular revue, known for its elaborate costumes and elaborate staging, became synonymous with the Tropicana’s brand. Beyond the *Folies*, the hotel regularly featured top-tier headliners, contributing significantly to the burgeoning Las Vegas entertainment scene. 

However, the early years of the Tropicana were also intertwined with some of the darker chapters of Las Vegas history. Like many Vegas resorts of the era, it had ties to organized crime. A significant skimming operation was run through the casino, funneling profits away from the IRS. Figures like Lefty Rosenthal were involved, adding a layer of notoriety and intrigue to the property’s narrative. While these connections eventually faded with changing ownership, they remain an indelible part of the Tropicana's story.

## Ownership Changes and Renovations

Over the decades, the Tropicana navigated numerous ownership changes. From Aztar Corporation to Columbia Sussex, and later Onex Corporation, each new owner brought different visions and strategies. The most significant changes came in 2007 when Onex acquired the property and initiated an $180 million renovation in 2011. This was an attempt to modernize the aging resort while attempting to retain some of its classic charm. These updates improved the hotel rooms and casino floor, but ultimately, it wasn't enough to stave off the inevitable. 

## A Final Curtain Call

In 2020, GLPI purchased the property, and shortly after, Bally’s Corporation acquired it and leased the land. The landmark agreement with the Oakland Athletics in 2023 sealed the Tropicana’s fate: demolition to make way for a new baseball stadium and a Bally’s hotel-casino resort. After 67 years of operation, the Tropicana closed its doors on April 2, 2024, just two days before its 68th birthday.  While its physical presence is gone, the Tropicana’s legacy – its vibrant history, its spectacular shows, and its place as a cornerstone of the Las Vegas Strip – will not be forgotten.  It was a place where old Vegas glamour met a complicated reality, leaving behind a bittersweet memory for those who experienced its tropical charm.
