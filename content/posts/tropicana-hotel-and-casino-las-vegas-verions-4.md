## A Lush Oasis Arrives on the Strip

When the [Tropicana Hotel and Casino](/posts/tropicana-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) burst onto the Las Vegas scene on April 4, 1957, it was an instant spectacle. Built on 35 acres – a vast expanse for the time – it represented the most expensive resort in Las Vegas, boasting over 1,400 rooms and a sprawling 44,570 square foot casino. Its lush, tropical landscaping, evoking a South Seas [paradise](/posts/paradise-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), was a deliberate departure from the more staid, traditional hotels that preceded it. The “Mermaid Lounge” fountain became an iconic symbol.

More than just a hotel, the [Tropicana](/posts/tropicana-country-club-las-vegas/) quickly became a Las Vegas institution. It wasn’t just about the rooms and games; it was about the *experience*. That included the legendary Folies Bergère, a lavish show that captivated audiences for decades, and remains the longest-running show in Las Vegas history. The constant stream of big-name entertainers added to the allure, solidifying its place as a premier entertainment destination.

## Shadowy Connections & Changing Hands

The Tropicana’s history, like much of early Las Vegas, isn’t without its darker chapters. Its early years were intertwined with organized crime, including a notorious skimming operation led by the Chicago Outfit. While these details often remain shrouded in secrecy, they undeniably colored the narrative of the resort’s beginnings. Ownership shifted hands multiple times, passing through Aztar Corporation, Columbia Sussex, and Onex Corporation. Each transition brought changes, some subtle, some more drastic.

## A Modern Makeover & A Final Act

In 2011, a significant $180 million renovation attempted to revitalize the aging property. While the changes brought a modern feel, the core identity – the tropical theme, the vintage charm – remained, albeit tempered. The 2020 sale to GLPI and subsequent lease to Bally’s Corporation signaled a significant shift. The eventual agreement with the Oakland Athletics to build a new baseball stadium on the Tropicana’s land marked the beginning of the end.

## The End of an Era & A New Beginning

After 67 years of operation, the Tropicana closed its doors on April 2, 2024, just two days before its 68th anniversary. It was a bittersweet farewell to a beloved landmark. While demolition is underway, paving the way for the New Las Vegas Stadium and a future Bally’s resort, the Tropicana’s legacy will live on. It stands as a testament to the evolution of Las Vegas, a place where dreams were built, fortunes were won and lost, and a unique brand of glamour was born. The echoes of the Folies Bergère and the rustling of palm trees will remain in the memories of those who experienced the magic of the Tropicana.
