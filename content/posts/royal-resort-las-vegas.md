## A Convention-Focused Beginning: Royal Las Vegas (1970-1973)

East of the dazzling lights of the Las Vegas Strip, a different kind of hospitality began in 1970. The Royal Las Vegas, originally part of the Royal Executive Inns chain, emerged at 99 Convention Center Drive. This wasn’t intended to be a Strip spectacle. The focus was squarely on servicing the burgeoning convention and business travel market that was increasingly important to Las Vegas’s economy. Located right next to the Las Vegas Convention Center, it offered a convenient and, importantly, more affordable alternative to the glitzier resorts further west.

## Adding a Little Sparkle: The Royal Casino Era (1973-1990s)

Around 1973, recognizing an opportunity, the Royal added a casino. This wasn't a sprawling, opulent gaming floor; it was a modest operation, often cited as housing only around 100 slot machines and a couple of blackjack tables. Rebranded as the Royal Casino, the property attempted to balance its convention-focused roots with a touch of gambling entertainment. This era saw it solidify its position as a budget-friendly option, appealing to attendees looking for a quick game after a long day at a trade show.

## Royal Hotel and Casino: A Name Change, A Continued Niche (1990s - 2003)

In the early 1990s, the hotel received another name change, becoming the Royal Hotel and Casino. Despite the change, the core business model remained consistent: reasonable rates and convenient access to the Convention Center. The casino remained a relatively small affair, a testament to the property’s original design and purpose. It carved out a quiet, reliable niche amongst the giants of the Strip.

## Transition to Royal Resort: Focusing on Lodging (2003 - 2022)

Recognizing the changing landscape and perhaps limited potential for casino expansion, the Royal shifted gears around 2003, closing the casino and concentrating entirely on its hotel function. Renamed the Royal Resort, it continued to serve a vital purpose, providing affordable lodging for convention visitors. It became a familiar, if unassuming, fixture in the Las Vegas skyline.

## A Final Chapter and Demolition (2022 - 2025)

The Royal’s story took a tragic turn in 2022 with a significant fire and subsequent water damage. While attempts were made to revive the property, the damage proved insurmountable. Now, in mid-2025, the Royal Resort is undergoing a liquidation sale, signaling its imminent demolition. Its legacy isn't one of grandeur or headline-grabbing events, but rather a quiet endurance. It was a property born to support Las Vegas’s business and convention traffic, a dependable option for budget-conscious travelers—a genuine piece of vintage Las Vegas history that's fading away.
