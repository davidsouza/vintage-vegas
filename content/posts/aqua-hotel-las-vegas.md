## A Humble Beginning: The Home Motel and a Fiery Start

The location at 1401 South Las Vegas Boulevard, now the Shalimar Hotel, boasts a layered history reflecting the evolving face of the Las Vegas Strip. Before the glitz and grandeur, it began as the Home Motel in the late 1930s – a modest auto-court catering to travelers passing through. This was a time when Las Vegas was still carving out its identity as a destination. Sadly, the Home Motel's early years were marked by tragedy: a significant fire in October 1941 devastated the property. But Las Vegas is built on resilience, and from the ashes rose something new.

## The Aqua Hotel Era: Embracing the Modern Motor Court

Rebuilt and rebranded shortly after the fire, the property emerged as the Aqua Hotel in the early 1950s. This period perfectly aligns with the booming post-war tourism wave that transformed Las Vegas. The Aqua embraced the modern motor-court aesthetic, a quintessential feature of the Las Vegas landscape at the time. Think driveway-front parking, convenient hotel-style rooms, and a welcoming vibe geared toward families and road-trippers. The name “Aqua” first appeared in use around 1953, and its increasingly elaborate neon signage quickly became a familiar landmark along the Strip's southern edge, a visual marker of the burgeoning resort corridor.

Guests could enjoy the typical amenities of the era – a cocktail lounge, restaurant, and a small coffee shop – all within easy reach of the rapidly developing casinos and hotels further north. The Aqua wasn't a destination resort itself, but it played a vital role as a reliable and affordable lodging option close to the action.

## Transition and Transformation: Becoming the Shalimar

The late 1980s brought another significant shift. As the Las Vegas Strip geared up for the high-rise era – characterized by larger, denser, and more luxurious hotels – the smaller motor courts like the Aqua Hotel began to face increasing pressure. Reflecting this change, the Aqua Hotel was renamed the Shalimar Hotel, and a two-story wing was added to the structure. This marked a move toward more standard economy lodging, recognizing the evolving needs and expectations of visitors.

## A Living Legacy: The Shalimar Today

Remarkably, the Shalimar Hotel (formerly the Aqua Hotel, before that the Home Motel) continues to operate today, a testament to its adaptability. While no longer a neon-lit landmark, it stands as a tangible link to Las Vegas’s past. The property retains its original address and offers a familiar service: affordable lodging, free parking, and a slice of classic Las Vegas history. The Shalimar’s story encapsulates the broader narrative of how Las Vegas's early motels gave way to expansive resorts, yet the echoes of that era – and the continuity of that specific parcel of land – endure.
