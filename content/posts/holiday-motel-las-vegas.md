## A Star is Born (and Sparkles!)

The [Holiday](/posts/holiday-casino-las-vegas/) Motel, originally the Holiday Inn (completely separate from the later national chain), emerged in the early 1950s along the then-U.S. 91, now Las Vegas Boulevard. This was a pivotal era for Las Vegas; the post-war boom fueled a surge in automobile travel, and the boulevard was transforming into the glittering artery of roadside lodging we associate with vintage Las Vegas.  Motor courts, providing affordable and convenient accommodations for travelers, entertainers, and conventioneers, were popping up everywhere, competing for attention amidst the rising casino glamour.

## The Googie Glow-Up

What truly set the Holiday Motel apart wasn’t its luxury - this was a budget-friendly option, after all - but its absolutely stunning neon sign. Constructed between 1956 and 1958, the sign was a prime example of the Googie architectural style – think swooping curves, starbursts, and a dynamic, forward-looking aesthetic. That chasing-bulb arrow and the stacked "Holiday Motel" panels became instantly recognizable, appearing on countless postcards and travelogues, solidifying its place in Vegas iconography.  It wasn't just a sign; it was a statement, a symbol of the optimism and energy pulsing through the city. The motel itself reflected the classic motor court design: low-lying, horizontal wings encircling a central parking court and a welcoming pool - perfect for weary travelers. 

## A Fading Light, A Lasting Legacy

For over six decades, the Holiday Motel stood as a testament to Las Vegas’s roadside roots.  By the 2000s, the property had undeniably seen better days, falling into disrepair. A devastating room fire in December 2016 further accelerated its decline, leading to its closure in 2017.  While the motel itself ceased operations, its legacy burned brightly – literally and figuratively.

## Saving the Sparkle: Preservation and Remembrance

The outpouring of support for preserving the iconic neon sign was immediate. A public campaign quickly mobilized, recognizing the historical significance of this radiant beacon.  Thankfully, the Las Vegas Neon Museum stepped in and secured the sign, dismantling and moving it to their restoration facility. Today, you can find the meticulously restored Holiday Motel sign shining brightly within the Neon Boneyard, a testament to the collective effort to preserve a piece of Las Vegas history.  While the motel itself now houses The BLVD Boutique Apartments, the sign ensures that the memory of the Holiday Motel – and the vibrant era it represents – continues to illuminate the Las Vegas landscape. It serves as a powerful reminder that Las Vegas wasn't solely built on sprawling mega-resorts, but on the welcoming hospitality of roadside motor courts like the Holiday Motel.
