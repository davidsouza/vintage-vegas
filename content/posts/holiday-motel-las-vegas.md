## A Slice of Mid-Century Motor Court Magic

The Las Vegas Strip wasn't always a landscape of towering mega-resorts. In the post-war boom of the early 1950s, it was a burgeoning ribbon of roadside motels catering to the growing wave of auto travelers. Among them shone the Holiday Motel, a beloved fixture along U.S. 91 (now Las Vegas Boulevard) that perfectly embodies the era's optimistic spirit. Originally debuting as the Holiday Inn (completely unrelated to the later national hotel chain) in 1952, it rebranded as the Holiday Motel by the early 1960s, mirroring the changing landscape of travel and roadside hospitality.

## The Sign That Sparkled

What truly set the Holiday Motel apart wasn't luxurious amenities (though it offered a convenient and budget-friendly option close to both Downtown and the burgeoning Strip), but its spectacular Googie-style pylon sign. Installed between 1956 and 1958, this neon masterpiece was a visual explosion of starbursts, a captivating chasing-bulb arrow, and stacked "Holiday Motel" panels. It wasn't just functional; it was an attraction, appearing on countless postcards and travelogues, solidifying its place in the collective memory of Las Vegas's roadside golden age. The sign truly *photographed* as well as any casino marquee!

## A Convenient Stop on the Road

The motel’s classic motor-court design – low, horizontal wings radiating around a central parking court and pool – was ideal for weary travelers. It catered to a diverse clientele: motorists cruising the highway, entertainers seeking affordable lodging, and conventioneers needing a convenient base of operations.  These were the folks who helped build Las Vegas, and the Holiday Motel provided a welcoming, mid-range option.

## Decline and Preservation

By the 2000s, like many vintage motels, the Holiday Motel showed its age. A devastating room fire in December 2016 further accelerated its decline, leading to its closure in 2017 after a remarkable 60+ year run. Fortunately, the sign’s enduring pop-culture cachet sparked a rapid preservation campaign.  Recognizing its historical significance, the Las Vegas Neon Museum stepped in, dismantling and relocating the sign to their restoration facility.

## Legacy in Lights

Today, the Holiday Motel itself stands as The BLVD Boutique Apartments. While its days as a motel are over, the vibrant neon sign lives on, proudly displayed within the Neon Boneyard. It serves as a powerful reminder that Las Vegas’s story is more than just glittering casinos; it’s a story of the hardworking roadside businesses, the friendly motor courts, and the countless travelers who helped shape the city we know today.  The starbursts and arrow of the Holiday Motel sign remain symbols of an era, preserved for future generations to admire."
