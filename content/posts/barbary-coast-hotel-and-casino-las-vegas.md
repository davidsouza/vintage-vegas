## A Stylish Alternative Arrives

The 1970s and 80s saw Las Vegas evolving rapidly. Mega-resorts were beginning to dominate the Strip, but there was still a hunger for something different. Enter the Barbary Coast Hotel & Casino, which opened its doors on March 2, 1979. Developed by Michael Gaughan, son of the legendary Jackie Gaughan, the Barbary Coast was designed to be an elegant, intimate alternative to the increasingly colossal properties that were becoming the norm. Its location – the "Four Corners" of Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road – was prime real estate, previously occupied by the Desert Villa/Times Square Motel. Facing opposition from bigger players worried about traffic and zoning, Gaughan persevered, skillfully navigating the challenges, even designing around existing power lines.

## Opulence and Grace

The Barbary Coast distinguished itself immediately. It boasted just 150 rooms and suites, a deliberate choice to maintain an intimate feel. The décor was lavish, reflecting a refined aesthetic absent in many newer casinos. Think stained-glass accents, dazzling chandeliers, and a breathtaking Tiffany-style mural, "The Garden of Earthly Delights," creating a uniquely sophisticated atmosphere. A quick expansion in the mid-80s added 50 rooms by ingeniously reconfiguring the parking structure, demonstrating Gaughan’s knack for smart growth.  Michael's Steakhouse, the casino's signature restaurant, was a standout, consistently praised for its quality and setting the stage for the eventual boom in fine dining throughout Las Vegas.

## A Community Response: The MGM Grand Fire

The Barbary Coast’s legacy isn't solely about opulent décor or fine dining.  The casino displayed true character during the tragic MGM Grand fire in November 1980. Michael Gaughan immediately ordered a complete evacuation and, without hesitation, transformed the Barbary Coast into an impromptu triage center for the injured.  This act of decisive leadership and community support cemented the Barbary Coast's place in Las Vegas history, demonstrating a heart often missing in the cutthroat world of casino development.

## Evolution and a Legacy of Entertainment

The late 90s saw another significant shift with the addition of Drai's After Hours in 1997, transforming a former McDonald's into one of the Strip’s most iconic late-night destinations. This cemented the Barbary Coast's position as a hub of entertainment, attracting a diverse crowd seeking an experience beyond gambling.  Acquired by Boyd Gaming in 2004 and later by Harrah’s Entertainment in 2006, the Barbary Coast continued to operate for nearly 28 years before its closure on February 27, 2007. The brief revival as Bill’s Gamblin’ Hall & Saloon was a poignant tribute to Bill Harrah, a founding father of Las Vegas gaming. Though now reimagined as The Cromwell, the Barbary Coast remains a fondly remembered chapter in vintage Las Vegas history, a testament to a time when sophistication and a commitment to community still held a prominent place on the Strip.
