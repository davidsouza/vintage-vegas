## A Stylish Alternative Rises on the Four Corners

The Las Vegas Strip in the late 1970s was dominated by sprawling mega-resorts. But nestled at the bustling intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road – the legendary “Four Corners” – a different kind of experience was about to emerge. On March 2, 1979, the Barbary Coast Hotel & Casino opened its doors, offering a sophisticated and intimate alternative to the increasingly colossal properties that defined the era.

Developed by Michael Gaughan, son of downtown Las Vegas icon Jackie Gaughan, the Barbary Coast wasn't just a casino; it was a statement. Built on the former Desert Villa/Times Square Motel site, its construction wasn’t without its challenges. Despite objections from neighboring giants worried about congestion, Gaughan navigated zoning hurdles and even cleverly incorporated the existing power lines into the design, a testament to his vision and planning. The initial 150 rooms and suites were a haven of elegance, boasting stunning stained-glass accents, glittering chandeliers, and a breathtaking Tiffany-style mural, “The Garden of Earthly Delights,” creating an atmosphere unlike anything else on the Strip.

## Grace Under Pressure & Fine Dining

The Barbary Coast quickly earned a reputation for more than just its stylish décor. In 1980, when the devastating MGM Grand fire unfolded, Michael Gaughan demonstrated true leadership. He swiftly evacuated his casino and, without hesitation, transformed it into an impromptu triage center, providing essential care to victims – a moment that cemented the Barbary Coast’s place in Las Vegas lore. It exemplified a community spirit often lost in the ever-growing spectacle of the Strip. 

Adding to its appeal was Michael’s Steakhouse, a signature dining destination that predated Vegas’s later obsession with fine dining. It was a place where quality and service reigned supreme. The mid-1980s saw a small expansion, adding 50 rooms by ingeniously reconfiguring the parking structure, proving the demand for the Barbary Coast’s unique brand of luxury. 

## Evolution and Legacy

In 1997, the casino evolved again with the addition of Drai’s After Hours, converting a former McDonald’s into a nightclub that became a hugely successful late-night destination, further enhancing the Barbary Coast’s reputation as a vibrant entertainment hub.  Acquired by Boyd Gaming in 2004 and later by Harrah’s Entertainment in 2006, the Barbary Coast’s nearly 28-year run came to an end in 2007. Though briefly reborn as Bill’s Gamblin’ Hall & Saloon (a nod to Bill Harrah's legacy), it ultimately transitioned into The Cromwell in 2014. Despite its transformation, the Barbary Coast remains a fondly remembered chapter in vintage Las Vegas history, a symbol of a bygone era of elegance, community, and a more intimate experience on the Strip.
