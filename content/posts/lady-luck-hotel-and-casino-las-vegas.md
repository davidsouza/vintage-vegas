## A Most Unlikely Beginning

The story of the Lady Luck Hotel & Casino isn’t one of opulent grandeur from the start. It’s a tale of humble beginnings and a surprising transition. Believe it or not, the space that now houses the Downtown Grand (formerly Lady Luck) was initially "Honest John's," a combination newsstand and barber shop!  This unassuming corner of the downtown core, located at 202 N Main Street, wasn't destined for casino fame. However, in 1964, everything changed. Andy Tompkins, a visionary entrepreneur, saw potential and transformed Honest John’s into a full-fledged casino.

## Lady Luck Arrives - A Downtown Darling

It wasn't until 1968 that the Lady Luck moniker officially graced the building.  Andy Tompkins founded the Lady Luck, aiming for a boutique casino experience, a refreshing contrast to the mega-resorts steadily popping up on the Strip.  The Lady Luck initially catered to a local crowd, providing a more intimate and less overwhelming gambling environment. It carved out a significant niche for itself, becoming a beloved, quirky part of downtown Las Vegas.  It exuded a charm and personality that reflected the era – a time when Las Vegas was less about spectacle and more about a friendly, accessible gaming experience. It was a place where you might actually strike up a conversation with your neighbor at the craps table! 

## Expansion and the Tower Years

The late 70s and 80s saw the Lady Luck expand its footprint. In 1979, the casino itself grew, and in 1986, the first tower (17 floors) was added, signaling a modernization and expansion of lodging options.  This was followed by Tower 2 in 1989, boasting a whopping 24 floors and significantly increasing the property’s capacity. These towers gave the Lady Luck a more contemporary feel while still retaining the friendly, approachable atmosphere that had made it so popular.



## Ownership Changes & A Temporary Hiatus

The Lady Luck's journey didn’t stop there. Throughout the early 2000s, the property passed through several hands – Isle of Capri Casinos, Steadfast AMX (who briefly experimented with timeshares!), and ultimately Henry Brent Co. in 2005.  Plans for a major renovation were announced, but financial difficulties put those projects on hold. Then, in 2007, CIM Group stepped in, acquiring the property for a substantial $100 million, signaling a significant shift in the Lady Luck's future.

## From Lady Luck to Downtown Grand – A Rebirth

In a bold move, CIM Group decided to completely rebrand the property.  October 2011 saw the Lady Luck officially transformed into the Downtown Grand, following a $100 million renovation. The new moniker and design aimed to revitalize the downtown core and offer a more modern, upscale experience, while still paying homage to its vintage roots.  Though the Lady Luck name is gone, its legacy of friendly service and quirky charm remains a nostalgic memory for many who remember its heyday. It's a testament to the ever-evolving story of Las Vegas and the enduring appeal of its early, more intimate days.
