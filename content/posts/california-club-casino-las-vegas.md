## A Fremont Street Original: The California Club Casino

Before mega-resorts and themed casinos dominated the Las Vegas landscape, downtown Fremont Street was the heart of the city’s gaming scene. And nestled amongst the other establishments, from the early 1950s until the early 1970s, stood the California Club Casino. Located at 101 East Fremont Street, this wasn't a flashy Strip spectacle; it was a “locals-first” casino, a place where workers and regular visitors felt welcomed and comfortable.

## Humble Beginnings and a Friendly Mascot

The California Club first opened its doors around 1951, initially under the ownership of Phil Copley and later Phil Long. It quickly became recognizable thanks to its cheerful bear mascot logo – a symbol of approachability and good times. Unlike the burgeoning mega-resorts on the Strip, the California Club focused on offering approachable games. Think standard table games and a selection of slots, providing a more relaxed and accessible experience than some of its competitors. The emphasis was on friendly service and building a loyal clientele. This down-to-earth atmosphere was a defining characteristic of the early Las Vegas experience.

## The Schivo Era and a Downtown Rebirth

The club underwent a significant transition in January 1967 when Frank Schivo, a prominent figure in Las Vegas gaming, along with partner Norbert Jansen, acquired the then-closed property. They reopened it as “Frank Schivo’s California Club,” a period considered vital to the club’s continuing presence in the downtown landscape. Schivo brought his own connections and vision, attempting to revitalize the casino and reaffirm its place in the competitive downtown market. While Schivo's tenure wasn’t long-lived, it represents an important chapter in the California Club’s story and the fluctuating fortunes of downtown casinos in the late 1960s.

## A Passing of an Era and a Legacy of Community

Sadly, the California Club’s run ended around 1970. The lease at 101 Fremont Street was purchased by the Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino in February 1971, and the California Club's identity gradually disappeared. The building itself was absorbed into the Golden Nugget’s expansion onto the Fremont Street frontage in 1983. 

Though physically gone, the California Club’s legacy remains. It stands as a reminder of a different era in Las Vegas – one of smaller, community-focused casinos that catered to locals and workers. It exemplifies the entrepreneurial spirit that fueled the city’s early growth and the constant evolution of the downtown casino landscape. The club’s story is a microcosm of the broader changes happening in Las Vegas, moving from a "locals-first" environment to the entertainment mecca we know today.
