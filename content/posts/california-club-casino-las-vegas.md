## A Downtown Gem: The California Club's Early Days

Before the mega-resorts dominated the Las Vegas Strip, downtown Fremont Street was *the* place to be. And tucked into the bustling scene at 101 East Fremont Street sat the California Club Casino, a beloved institution that embodied the spirit of mid-century Las Vegas. Opening in the early 1950s, initially under the ownership of Phil Copley (later Phil Long), the California Club wasn't about dazzling shows or sprawling pools. It was about friendly faces, approachable games, and a welcoming atmosphere that catered to both downtown workers and local residents.

The casino quickly became recognizable by its distinctive bear mascot logo – a symbol of its down-to-earth appeal. The focus wasn't on high rollers; it was on creating a comfortable and reliable gaming experience. You’d find folks enjoying classic table games and simple slot machines, all within a relaxed setting – a stark contrast to the glitz and glamour steadily rising on the Strip.

## Frank Schivo and a Renewed Vision

The California Club faced its share of ownership changes, reflecting the competitive and sometimes volatile nature of the downtown casino market. A significant chapter began around January 1967 when Frank Schivo, a well-respected name in Las Vegas gaming, partnered with Norbert Jansen to acquire and reopen the then-closed casino. Schivo rebranded it as “Frank Schivo’s California Club,” reaffirming its place in the downtown landscape. 

Schivo brought his expertise and connections, aiming to revitalize the property. His time marked a continuation of the club’s welcoming vibe, though it also reflected his own leadership style. He maintained the core values – a focus on regular customers and a casual atmosphere – while striving for a renewed presence amongst the evolving downtown scene.

## A Fading Legacy, A Lasting Impact

Unfortunately, the California Club’s time was relatively brief. By 1970, the club's run under Schivo and previous owners drew to a close. The lease at 101 Fremont was purchased by the Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino in February 1971, effectively absorbing the California Club's identity into the larger operation. The building itself became part of the Golden Nugget’s expanding footprint, a physical reminder of how the downtown landscape was changing.

While the original California Club Casino no longer exists as a standalone entity, its legacy endures. It represents a pivotal era in Las Vegas history – a time when the focus was on community and genuine hospitality, and when downtown reigned supreme. It stands as a testament to the entrepreneurial spirit of early Las Vegas and serves as a poignant reminder of a simpler, yet undeniably vibrant, chapter in the city's history. Today, that space contributes to the energy of the Golden Nugget and the Fremont Street Experience, but the memory of the California Club lives on in the hearts of those who remember its charm.
