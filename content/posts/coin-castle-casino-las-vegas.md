## A Castle of Coins on Fremont Street

The Fremont Street Experience is undeniably a Vegas institution today, but for decades, it was a different beast – a grittier, more character-driven scene dominated by small casinos, each vying for attention. Among those memorable spots was the Coin Castle Casino, a quirky and spirited fixture from 1970 to 1999. It wasn't a sprawling mega-resort, but what it lacked in size, it more than made up for in personality.

## The Early Days: Blackjack and Street Promotions

Coin Castle first opened its doors on September 4, 1970, under the ownership of Don Petit. Initially, it offered a full complement of gaming options, including blackjack alongside a robust selection of slot machines. The casino really embraced the energy of Fremont Street.  Outside, hawkers were a constant presence, a bustling chorus of voices calling out to pedestrians, handing out key rings, coupons, and generally hyping the casino’s offerings. This wasn’t the polished marketing we see today; it was a lively, almost chaotic, invitation to “come in and play!” It was the classic, unfiltered Vegas hustle.

## The Herb Pastor Era and the Slots-Only Focus

A significant shift occurred in 1977 when Herbert "Herb" Pastor acquired Petit’s share. This marked a transition for the Coin Castle.  Pastor decided to focus solely on slots, eliminating blackjack and other table games. This allowed the casino to concentrate on optimizing its floor for maximum slot machine capacity and bolstering its signature promotional efforts.

## The Castle Vibe and Coin Clatter

The Coin Castle truly distinguished itself with its playful and consistent "castle" theme. Neon signage, evoking royal imagery, adorned the exterior, and the interior was decorated accordingly. But perhaps the most iconic aspect was the use of those distinctive tin payout trays beneath the slot machines. The metallic clang of coins spilling into those trays became the soundtrack of the Coin Castle, a unique sensory experience that patrons fondly remember. Combined with the enthusiastic floor staff and the energetic announcers using microphones to build excitement, it was a lively and unforgettable atmosphere.  Small giveaways – Mardi Gras beads, coupons, and occasional perks – further reinforced the casino's commitment to creating a memorable player experience.

## From Castle to La Bayou and Beyond

In 1999, Pastor initiated a renovation and rebranding effort, transforming Coin Castle into La Bayou. This change mirrored the evolving tastes of Las Vegas gamblers and the increasing competition on Fremont Street. The castle motif was sadly retired, and many of the original neon signs, including the beloved “king” statue and signature lettering, found a new home at the Neon Museum, ensuring their preservation for future generations. Today, the site is occupied by the impressive Circa Resort and Casino, a testament to the constant evolution of Las Vegas.

The Coin Castle Casino might be gone, but its memory lives on. It serves as a potent reminder of an era when smaller, themed casinos carved out their niches, relying on personality, playful promotion, and the satisfying sound of clinking coins to draw in players – a truly unique and vibrant chapter in Las Vegas history.
