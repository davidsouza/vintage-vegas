## A Royal Welcome on Fremont Street

Downtown Las Vegas' Fremont Street has always been a landscape of constant change, but some casinos leave a more enduring mark than others. Coin Castle Casino, a small but spirited property operating from 1970 to 1999, is one such place. For nearly three decades, it offered a unique slice of vintage Las Vegas, a far cry from the mega-resorts that would later dominate the Strip.

Opened on September 4, 1970, by Don Petit, Coin Castle initially offered a mix of slot machines and blackjack. Those early years were defined by energetic street-level promotions. Think hawkers calling out to passersby, raining down promotional key rings and coupons, and generally creating a festive atmosphere to lure in players. It was a different era; the focus was on personality and creating a memorable experience, not just luxury.

## From Castle to Coins: A Shift in Strategy

The casino's identity took a significant turn in 1977 when Herbert “Herb” Pastor acquired Petit's share. Pastor’s leadership led to a strategic shift: the removal of table games, focusing entirely on slots. This decision, while seemingly simple, cemented Coin Castle’s future. It allowed the casino to cultivate a unique and intensely memorable vibe.

## A Castle of Clinking Coins

Coin Castle truly lived up to its name. The playful castle theme wasn't just for show; it was woven into the fabric of the experience. Neon signage evoked royal imagery, and the interior was carefully designed to reinforce the playful aesthetic. Perhaps most memorably, the casino utilized tin payout trays beneath the slot machines. The clinking and cascading sounds of coins – a delightful cacophony for players – became synonymous with Coin Castle. The energetic floor staff and frequent announcements over microphones, hyping the action, only added to the atmosphere. Coupled with small giveaways like Mardi Gras beads and coupons, it was a constant celebration.

## The Curtain Falls, But the Memory Remains

In 1999, Pastor decided to renovate and rebrand the property as La Bayou. The transformation signaled an evolution in Las Vegas tastes and increased competition on Fremont Street. The iconic “king” statue and the distinctive “Coin Castle” lettering disappeared, but fortunately, much of the signage found a new home at the Neon Museum, preserving a piece of Las Vegas history for future generations. While the building now houses Circa Resort and Casino, the memory of Coin Castle lives on. It serves as a poignant reminder of an era where smaller, themed casinos could thrive, relying on charm, promotion, and that unmistakable sound of cascading coins to draw players in.
