## A Brief Encounter: The Rendezvous Hotel and Casino

Downtown Las Vegas in the late 1970s was a whirlwind of change. The glitz and glamour of the burgeoning Las Vegas Strip was drawing visitors away, leaving Fremont Street facing increasing competition. Amidst this turbulence, smaller casinos fought to survive, constantly rebranding and experimenting to lure in gamblers. One such attempt, though ultimately brief, was the Rendezvous Hotel and Casino, located at 400 E. Ogden Avenue. 

## From Lodge to Casino: A History of the Location

The Rendezvous didn't spring up out of thin air. The building had a history before its short stint as a casino. It originally operated as the Grace Hayes Lodge, catering to travelers seeking lodging and entertainment. Later, it became The Patio, further cementing its place as a local fixture. In 1977, a new vision arose: transform this establishment into a full-fledged casino. This marked the beginning of the Rendezvous era.

## A Gamble on Downtown

The Rendezvous aimed to inject some energy back into the downtown scene. Offering classic casino games like craps, blackjack, slots, and even keno, it aimed to draw customers away from the Strip and back to the heart of Vegas. To sweeten the deal, patrons were frequently given complimentary drink chips – a tactic common in those days to keep gamblers playing. The casino’s location, relatively close to the Fremont Street Experience, was strategic, hoping to capture foot traffic.

## Nine Months & Gone: The Rendezvous's Fleeting Life

Despite the initial optimism, the Rendezvous’s run was tragically short. After just about nine months in operation, the casino closed its doors under that name in 1978. The competitive pressure of the Las Vegas market proved too much for the small operation. It was quickly rebranded as The Big Nickel, a more playful and ambitious concept. 

## Legacy of a Brief Spark

While the Rendezvous Hotel and Casino might not be a household name, it’s a valuable piece of Las Vegas history. It exemplifies the speculative and risky nature of the city's gaming landscape during a period of significant transition. The Rendezvous’s story - the quick rebranding, the complimentary drink chips, and the struggle to survive – paints a vivid picture of downtown Las Vegas in the 1970s. Today, the location is part of the Gold Spike, continuing its legacy as a lively and entertaining spot on Fremont Street, a far cry from its days as the short-lived Rendezvous Hotel and Casino, but forever etched in the annals of vintage Las Vegas.
