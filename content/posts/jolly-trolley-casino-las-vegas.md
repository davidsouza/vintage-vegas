## A Trolley Full of Trouble: Introducing Jolly Trolley Casino

The Las Vegas Strip has seen its share of themed casinos, but few were as distinctive – and as… memorable – as the Jolly Trolley Casino. Located at 2440 Las Vegas Boulevard South, directly across from the Sahara, it burst onto the scene in 1977, replacing Honest John’s and the Centerfold Casino. What made it stand out? Everything, really. From its vibrant, trolley-car shaped marquee to its unapologetically adult-themed atmosphere, Jolly Trolley was a concentrated dose of 1970s Vegas weirdness.

## The "Naked But Nice" Era and a Generous Fun Book

Jolly Trolley wasn’t shy about its entertainment. Slogans like “Burlesque is Back – Naked But Nice” and “Macho Male Strippers – Ladies Only” were plastered everywhere, signaling a decidedly different kind of experience than the more polished casinos that were starting to emerge. But beyond the showmanship, Jolly Trolley understood the value of a deal. Their "Fun Book," worth a whopping $18, was a stroke of genius. Imagine: free meals, drinks, hot dogs, phone calls, and *free valet parking*! The parking perk, as one former employee hilariously recounted, proved so popular that valets received absolutely no tips – a truly unique Vegas phenomenon.

## Games, Grub, and Gambler's Gimmicks

The casino floor itself wasn’t about high-roller luxury. Single-deck blackjack, with a pit boss who playfully flashed hole cards (much to players’ delight and advantage!), was the game of choice. And for those feeling hungry, Jolly Trolley touted “Las Vegas’ Biggest Hamburger” for a mere 99½ cents – a bargain by any standard. Beyond the games and food, the casino became a collector's paradise. Slot-machine souvenirs, wooden-nickel tokens, and commemorative $1 and $5 chips became highly sought-after memorabilia for vintage casino enthusiasts today.

## Mob Connections and a Rapid Exit

Like many Vegas institutions of that era, Jolly Trolley wasn't without its shadowy connections. Rumors of mob influence swirled, with the notorious Tony Spilotro, operating under frontmen like Don Pettit and Paul Bendetti, reportedly a frequent patron. The FBI's surveillance of the establishment only amplified its edgy reputation. Sadly, this wild ride couldn't last. In 1981, the Jolly Trolley closed its doors, paving the way for something entirely different: the Bonanza Gift Shop, which, surprisingly, remains a Strip staple to this day as "The World's Largest Gift Shop."

## A Cheeky Footnote in Vegas Lore

While brief, the Jolly Trolley Casino’s legacy endures. It represents a particular brand of vintage Vegas – unapologetic, playful, and a little bit dangerous. It's a reminder of a time when the Strip was still carving out its identity, a time when quirky themed casinos and playful marketing tactics reigned supreme. So, the next time you’re strolling down Las Vegas Boulevard South, remember the Jolly Trolley – a trolley full of memories, and a uniquely Vegas story.
