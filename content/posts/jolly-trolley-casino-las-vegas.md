## A Trolley Full of Trouble: Introducing Jolly Trolley Casino

The Las Vegas Strip has seen its share of themed casinos, but few were as memorable – or as delightfully scandalous – as the Jolly Trolley Casino. Located at 2440 Las Vegas Boulevard South, right across from the [Sahara](/posts/sahara-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), the Trolley debuted in 1977, transforming a former shopping center into a vibrant, adult-themed playground. Its eye-catching, trolley-shaped marquee wasn’t just decoration; it perfectly embodied the playful, and at times provocative, atmosphere within. Before the Trolley, the location housed Honest John’s and the [Centerfold Casino](/posts/centerfold-casino-las-vegas/), each hinting at the adult entertainment that would define Jolly Trolley’s brief but impactful run.

## More Than Meets the Eye (and the Marquee)

Jolly Trolley wasn’t shy about its appeal. Slogans like “Burlesque is Back – Naked But Nice” and “Macho Male Strippers – Ladies Only” boldly declared its unique proposition. But it was more than just a show; it was a shrewd business model. The casino’s famed “Fun Book,” valued at a hefty $18, offered an astonishing array of perks. Think complimentary meals, drinks, hot dogs, free phone calls, and even – unbelievably – free valet parking. A testament to its popularity, employees even reported patrons utilizing the free valet without a single tip!

Inside, the gaming was enticing. Single-deck blackjack was a draw, with a playful pit-boss gimmick of flashing hole cards – a quirky detail that amused players. And if you’re hungry, Jolly Trolley boasted “Las Vegas’ Biggest Hamburger” for just 99½ cents. Collectors today prize the casino's souvenirs: slot-machine trinkets, wooden-nickel tokens, and those sought-after $1 and $5 chips are prized memorabilia.

## Mob Connections and a Short Ride

The Jolly Trolley’s story is also intertwined with the darker side of Vegas history. Rumors of mob influence were rampant, with speculation about connections to owners like Don Pettit and Paul Bendetti. The notorious Tony Spilotro, a significant figure in Chicago’s organized crime, was even reportedly a regular patron. The FBI’s attention, fueled by these whispers and investigations, contributed to the casino's edgy reputation.

Despite its popularity, the Jolly Trolley’s reign was short-lived, ending abruptly in 1981. Its departure made way for something equally… unique. The space was quickly converted into [Bonanza](/posts/bonanza-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Gift Shop, proclaiming itself "The World’s Largest Gift Shop," a title it still proudly holds.

## A Cheeky Footnote in Vegas Lore

The Jolly Trolley Casino may be gone, but it hasn't been forgotten. It represents a specific and fascinating era of Las Vegas – a time of outrageous themes, adult entertainment pushing boundaries, and a simmering undercurrent of organized crime. While the Bonanza Gift Shop carries on, the memory of the Jolly Trolley Casino remains a vibrant and cheeky footnote in the ever-evolving story of the Las Vegas Strip.
