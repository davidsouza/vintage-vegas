## From Foxy’s Deli to a Brewing Revolution

The northeast corner of Sahara and the Strip has seen countless changes over the decades, but few establishments left a mark as unique as the Holy Cow! Casino Cafe Brewery. Its story isn't just about a casino; it's about a slice of Vegas history, encompassing inclusive origins, groundbreaking brewing, and a whole lot of local charm. The site’s earliest incarnation was Foxy’s Deli, which opened in 1955. Remarkably, Foxy’s held the distinction of being the Strip’s first integrated restaurant, a progressive move at a time when racial segregation was still a stark reality in many parts of the country. Legendary performers like Liberace, Wayne Newton, and Shecky Greene were frequent patrons, solidifying its place in the early Vegas scene.

## The Firehouse Years and Big Dog's Vision

The venue underwent a transformation in 1976, becoming Foxy’s Firehouse Casino. This iteration lasted until 1988. Then, in 1992, the dynamic Tom "Big Dog" Wiesner acquired the property and embarked on his vision: Holy Cow!  The rebranding was more than just a name change; it was a complete reinvention. Wiesner envisioned a place that combined a casino, cafe, and, crucially, a brewery – a concept that would reshape Las Vegas’s beverage landscape.

## Brewing History & Alphie the Cow

The real game-changer came in 1993 when Wiesner successfully lobbied Nevada lawmakers to allow breweries within Las Vegas city limits. This paved the way for Holy Cow! to become the state’s first brewpub, instantly marking it as a pioneer. The brewery’s success was undeniable; their English Pale Ale earned a gold medal in 1993, followed by bronzes for their Red Ale and Stout. Over the next few years, the brewery crafted over 800 batches of beer and became a fixture at beer festivals. And, of course, there was Alphie – the 14-foot fiberglass Holstein cow sporting sunglasses, instantly recognizable and embodying the venue's playful spirit.

## A Relaxed Oasis on the Strip

Unlike the opulent, high-energy casinos that dominate the Strip, Holy Cow! offered a more relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Patrons appreciated the cozy ambiance, the mingling sounds of slot machines and brewing beer, and the genuinely friendly vibe.  A memorable touch was the wall autographed by beloved Cubs announcer Harry Caray, a testament to the casual, convivial atmosphere.

## The End of an Era & A Lasting Legacy

Sadly, the post 9/11 downturn in tourism proved insurmountable. Holy Cow! closed its doors on March 22, 2002. Though the brewery operations relocated, the original location remained vacant before eventually being demolished in 2012, now occupied by a Walgreens.  However, Alphie lives on, finding a new home outside the Longstreet Inn & Casino in Amargosa Valley, ensuring that the spirit of Holy Cow! continues to be remembered. The "Holy Cow!" Casino Cafe Brewery wasn't just a place to gamble or grab a bite; it was a unique symbol of Las Vegas's evolution and a reminder of a time when local charm and pioneering spirit reigned supreme.
