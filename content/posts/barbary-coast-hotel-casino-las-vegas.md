## A Stylish Alternative on the Strip

The Las Vegas Strip has always been about evolution, but sometimes, it’s about offering something *different*. That's precisely what Michael Gaughan envisioned when he opened the Barbary Coast Hotel & Casino on March 2, 1979. Built on the former site of the Desert Villa/Times Square Motel, the Barbary Coast arrived at a moment when the Strip was increasingly dominated by sprawling mega-resorts. Gaughan, son of downtown casino legend Jackie Gaughan, wanted to create a more intimate and elegant experience – a haven from the overwhelming scale of its neighbors.

## Design & Early Success

The Barbary Coast quickly distinguished itself. It wasn't just about the 150 rooms and suites, though their opulent touches – stained-glass accents, gleaming chandeliers, and the breathtaking Tiffany-style mural, *The Garden of Earthly Delights* – made them special. The clever design that navigated existing power lines showcased a level of planning and ingenuity that became a hallmark of the property. An expansion in the mid-80s, adding 50 rooms cleverly integrated into the parking structure, further cemented its place on the Strip.

## A True Community Spirit

Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the Barbary Coast also demonstrated remarkable grace under pressure. The tragic 1980 MGM Grand fire remains a dark chapter in Las Vegas history. Yet, in the immediate aftermath, Michael Gaughan’s decisive leadership shone. He ordered a swift evacuation of his casino and, crucially, transformed it into an impromptu triage center for the injured. This act of generosity and community spirit resonated deeply within the city and showcased the Barbary Coast as more than just a casino – it was a place of compassion and support.

## Dining & Nightlife Evolution

Michael's Steakhouse, the casino’s signature dining room, anticipated Las Vegas’s later fine-dining boom, consistently earning critical acclaim. Later, the acquisition and transformation of the former McDonald’s space into Drai’s After Hours in 1997 added a vibrant late-night dimension, establishing a nightlife institution that remains a Strip staple today.

## A Farewell & Legacy

In 2004, Boyd Gaming acquired the Barbary Coast, followed by a transfer to Harrah’s Entertainment in 2006. Sadly, after nearly 28 years, the Barbary Coast closed its doors on February 27, 2007. While briefly resurrected as Bill’s Gamblin’ Hall & Saloon as a tribute to Bill Harrah, it ultimately became The Cromwell in 2014. Though the name and design are gone, the Barbary Coast’s legacy lives on—a reminder of a time when elegance, grace, and a genuine sense of community were key ingredients in the Las Vegas Strip experience. It’s a chapter we remember fondly in the ongoing saga of vintage Las Vegas.
