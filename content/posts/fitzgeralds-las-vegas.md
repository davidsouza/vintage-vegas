## A New Player on Fremont Street: The Birth of [Fitzgeralds](/posts/fitzgeralds-hotel-and-casino/)

Downtown Las Vegas in the 1980s was a vibrant, slightly rough-around-the-edges spectacle. The Strip was evolving, but Fremont Street remained the heart of Vegas excitement. In 1987, a new casino, Fitzgeralds, joined the fray, rising on the site of the previously existing [Sundance Hotel and Casino](/posts/sundance-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/). It was instantly recognizable, boasting a classic, approachable feel, a stark contrast to the increasingly themed and opulent mega-resorts taking shape elsewhere. Fitzgeralds aimed for a comfortable, welcoming atmosphere, appealing to a broad range of players and instantly becoming a downtown staple.

## A Historic Ownership Moment

The early 2000s brought challenges. After Fitzgeralds Gaming declared bankruptcy in December 2001, the property was acquired by Don Barden's Majestic Star Casino, LLC. This acquisition wasn't just about business; it was a pivotal moment in Las Vegas history. Don Barden became the first African American casino owner in the city, shattering barriers and paving the way for increased diversity within the gaming industry. While he also acquired Fitzgeralds casinos in Mississippi and Colorado, he recognized the potential in the Las Vegas location.

## Revitalization and a Pivot

Just two years later, Barden smartly separated Fitzgeralds Las Vegas from the Majestic Star group to unlock potential for growth, removing restrictions tied to lenders. He then initiated a substantial multimillion-dollar renovation. This wasn’t just cosmetic; it modernized the casino, improved the ambiance, and revitalized customer patronage. It breathed new life into the Fremont Street experience. The initial plan to utilize Fitzgeralds as a springboard for a Pittsburgh slots venture ultimately fell through, but the investment had already served its purpose: renewing Fitzgeralds’ appeal.

## The Legacy Continues – Briefly

Don Barden’s passing in October 2011 marked the end of an era for Fitzgeralds. His estate, seeking a buyer, found a new steward in the Stevens brothers – Derek and Greg, owners of the legendary [Golden Gate](/posts/golden-gate-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Casino. They recognized the continued potential of the location and, in Fall 2012, rebranded Fitzgeralds as The D Las Vegas. While the Fitzgeralds name is gone, the history and the legacy of its comfortable, accessible vibe lives on in the spirit of Downtown Las Vegas. The location itself remains a vibrant hub, carrying echoes of the classic Vegas charm that Fitzgeralds once embodied.
