## A Post-War Bingo Boom on the Strip

Before mega-resorts and celebrity chef restaurants, Las Vegas offered simpler pleasures. One of those was bingo, and Club Bingo, established on July 24, 1947, became a central hub for local players. Located on South Las Vegas Boulevard (now part of the Strip!), its 300-seat parlor, paired with the adjacent “Bonanza Room” for dining and entertainment, quickly gained popularity. The vision of Milton Prell and Al Winter, seasoned casino developers, and managed by Frank Schivo, Club Bingo wasn't flashy, but its striking electric bingo board sign made it instantly recognizable—a beacon of good times and easy wins.  Initially, Prell envisioned grander plans, even considering a small hotel or an adobe-style village expansion. However, the tides of Las Vegas development were changing.

## From Strip to Sahara: A Short But Sweet Run

In 1952, a pivotal moment arrived. Club Bingo was sold and cleverly incorporated into the brand-new Sahara Hotel & Casino. While the bingo parlor transitioned into the Sahara’s coffee shop, it marked the end of Club Bingo’s original standalone existence.  The original building was ultimately demolished, lost to the relentless march of progress and expansion on the Strip.

## Fremont Street’s Luxurious Bingo Parlor

But the story doesn’t end there!  Like a phoenix rising, Club Bingo was reborn on August 31, 1962, on Fremont Street. This iteration, owned by the influential Sam Diamond and Jackie Gaughan, was a significant upgrade.  Branded as “America’s most luxurious bingo parlor,” it offered amenities unheard of in its earlier days – including complimentary parking at the Las Vegas Club!  Beyond the thrilling bingo action, this Club Bingo also featured Roulette, Blackjack (21), and slot machines, catering to a wider range of gamblers.

## A Legacy in Collectibles & Memories

In 1983, the Pioneer Club's expansion claimed Club Bingo's space, ushering in yet another change. Today, the site houses an ABC store and a Pioneer Club souvenir shop, a far cry from its bingo-filled past. Despite its physical disappearance, Club Bingo’s legacy lives on. Vintage matchbooks, tokens, and drinking cards are treasured collectibles for Vegas memorabilia enthusiasts, offering a tangible link to a bygone era.  Old photographs capture the neon charm and the unique atmosphere of a time when Las Vegas was a more intimate and accessible place – a nostalgic bridge between the classic saloon and the modern casino. Club Bingo stands as a reminder of the diverse and evolving history of Las Vegas bingo and its place in the city's colorful story.
