## From Strip Standalone to Fremont Street Flair: The Story of Club Bingo Las Vegas

Before mega-resorts and dazzling spectacles, Las Vegas thrived on simpler pleasures. Among them? Bingo! And for a time, Club Bingo was *the* place to be for locals and tourists alike. Its story offers a fascinating glimpse into the evolution of Las Vegas entertainment, showcasing two distinct eras.

## The Original: A Post-War Strip Landmark

Club Bingo first burst onto the scene on July 24, 1947, at 2535 South Las Vegas Boulevard. Imagine the Strip back then - less glitzy, more modest. Milton Prell and Al Winter, seasoned gaming entrepreneurs, envisioned a dedicated 300-seat bingo parlor, complete with the appealing addition of a “Bonanza Room” for dining and entertainment. Managed by Frank Schivo, Club Bingo quickly became a beloved local hangout. It wasn’t a grand palace – the design was intentionally understated – but its electric bingo board sign, a beacon of neon fun, made it instantly recognizable.

Prell initially dreamt of expanding the property into something more ambitious – a small hotel or even an adobe-style village! However, the winds of change were blowing. In 1952, the property was sold, a pivotal moment that saw Club Bingo incorporated into the then-newly constructed Sahara Hotel & Casino, its space repurposed as a coffee shop. The original structure soon vanished, marking the end of its reign on the Strip. 

## A Luxurious Rebirth on Fremont Street

But the story doesn't end there! A second act for Club Bingo began August 31, 1962, on Fremont Street at 21–23. This iteration, owned by Sam Diamond and Jackie Gaughan – titans of the Las Vegas casino world – was something special. They proclaimed it “America’s most luxurious bingo parlor,” and it lived up to the hype. Free parking (courtesy of the Las Vegas Club!) and a wider range of entertainment, including Roulette, Blackjack (21), and slot machines, elevated the experience. 

## A Legacy in Collectibles and Memories

Sadly, Club Bingo’s Fremont Street days were numbered too. In 1983, the expanding Pioneer Club took over its space. Today, the location houses an ABC Stores and the Pioneer Club souvenir shop. While the physical spaces are gone, the memory of Club Bingo lives on. Vintage matchbooks, unique tokens, and those iconic bingo drinking cards are prized collectibles, circulating among memorabilia enthusiasts. Vintage photographs offer a nostalgic window into a vibrant era of Las Vegas – a time when bingo held a prominent place in the city's playful, halfway-between-saloon and casino culture. Club Bingo’s story is a powerful reminder of how Las Vegas has constantly reinvented itself, while always cherishing its roots.
