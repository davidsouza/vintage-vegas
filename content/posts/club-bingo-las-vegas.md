## A Postwar Start on the Strip

Las Vegas in 1947 was a city rapidly transforming from a desert outpost into an entertainment destination. Amidst the burgeoning casinos and burgeoning glamour, a more modest institution opened its doors: Club Bingo, located at 2535 South Las Vegas Boulevard. Founded on July 24th by the sharp minds of Milton Prell and Al Winter – titans of early Vegas gaming – and expertly managed by Frank Schivo, Club Bingo offered something unique: a dedicated 300-seat bingo parlor. It wasn’t about high rollers or extravagant shows; it was about community, a little luck, and a friendly game. 

What made it instantly recognizable wasn’t its opulent interior (it was, by design, quite modest) but the bold, electric bingo board sign that blazed across the Strip. It was a beacon for locals looking for an affordable and entertaining evening.  An adjoining "[Bonanza](/posts/bonanza-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Room" provided sustenance and extra entertainment, solidifying its place as a local hangout.  Prell even briefly considered grander visions for the property, envisioning a small hotel or an adobe-style village, but the changing landscape of Las Vegas pulled him in other directions.

## Fremont Street’s “Most Luxurious”

The original Club Bingo’s time on the Strip was relatively short. In 1952, it was absorbed into the newly built [Sahara](/posts/sahara-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Hotel & Casino, becoming its unassuming coffee shop.  Its physical presence vanished, but the spirit of bingo remained.  Fast forward to August 31, 1962, and a second incarnation of Club Bingo appeared, this time nestled on Fremont Street at 21-23.

This iteration, owned by the legendary Sam Diamond and Jackie Gaughan – cornerstones of Las Vegas casino history – was a different beast entirely. Diamond and Gaughan touted it as "America's most luxurious bingo parlor," and they delivered. Free parking at the [Las Vegas Club](/posts/las-vegas-club-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) was a significant perk, and beyond the bingo tables, guests could enjoy games of Roulette, Blackjack (21), and slot machines, expanding the entertainment options. This Club Bingo represented a shift, moving beyond a purely bingo-focused offering and embracing a wider range of classic casino games. 

## A Vanished Venue, A Lasting Legacy

The rise of the [Pioneer Club](/posts/pioneer-club-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) ultimately led to Club Bingo’s second disappearance. In 1983, the Pioneer’s expansion absorbed the Fremont Street location. Today, that space is occupied by an ABC Stores and a Pioneer Club souvenir shop - a far cry from the buzzing energy of a bingo parlor.

But the legacy of Club Bingo lives on. For collectors of vintage Las Vegas memorabilia, old matchbooks, tokens, and drinking cards are treasured relics of a bygone era.  Historical photographs capturing its neon glow evoke a sense of nostalgia for a Las Vegas that existed between the saloon and the modern casino.  Club Bingo serves as a poignant reminder of the evolution of Las Vegas, showcasing the diverse range of entertainment options that have defined this unique city.
