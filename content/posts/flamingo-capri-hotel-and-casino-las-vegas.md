The Las Vegas Strip has seen countless transformations, but the story of what now stands as The Linq is particularly fascinating, showcasing the ever-evolving nature of Vegas entertainment. We’re going back to 1959 to explore the life and times of the Flamingo Capri Hotel and Casino.

## A Humble Beginning: The Capri Arrives

In October 1959, a new motel, the Flamingo Capri, popped up on the Las Vegas Strip. Located right next to the iconic Flamingo Hotel and Casino (itself steeped in history!), the Capri was a more modest affair, offering just 180 rooms. It was the brainchild of George E. Goldberg and Bill Capri - a partnership that, sadly, wouldn't last long. Capri eventually departed the company, leaving Goldberg as the sole proprietor.

The late 1950s and early 1960s were a pivotal time for Las Vegas. The city was rapidly transitioning from a desert outpost to a booming entertainment destination. Motels like the Flamingo Capri catered to a growing wave of tourists eager for a taste of the burgeoning Vegas experience – a little less glitz than the larger casinos, but still offering that distinctive West Coast vibe. It represented a more affordable option on a strip that was increasingly catering to a higher-end clientele.

## Ralph Engelstad and a Big Change

The 1970s brought a significant shift. In 1971, Ralph Engelstad, a shrewd businessman known for his ventures in ski resorts and later, casinos, purchased the Flamingo Capri. Engelstad had a vision – and that vision included a casino. In 1972, he added one, marking a huge upgrade for the property. This expansion signaled Engelstad's ambition to compete with the bigger players on the Strip.

This was also the decade where Vegas really started to embrace the “mega-resort” concept. While the Flamingo Capri was initially a motel, Engelstad's addition of a casino brought it more squarely into the competitive casino landscape.

## Imperial Palace and Beyond

1979 saw another significant rebranding. The Flamingo Capri was renamed the Imperial Palace. This change reflected the property's evolution and the more grandiose ambitions of its owner.  Engelstad continued to expand, and in 1977, a 19-story tower was added, dramatically increasing the room count from 300 to 650. For a time, the Imperial Palace even operated as part of the Best Western chain, an interesting chapter in its history.

The Imperial Palace thrived for decades, a reliable and popular destination on the Strip. Although it never reached the heights of some of its glitzier neighbors, it offered a consistent Vegas experience.

## A Legacy Reimagined

The Imperial Palace finally closed its doors in 2012, paving the way for a new generation of entertainment. The property was redeveloped and is now home to The Linq Hotel and Casino, complete with the High Roller observation wheel. While the Imperial Palace is gone, its history remains an important piece of Las Vegas Strip lore – a reminder of the city’s constant reinvention and the evolution of the Vegas dream.
