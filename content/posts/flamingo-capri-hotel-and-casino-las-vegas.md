## A Stylish Start: The Flamingo Capri's Debut (1959)

The Las Vegas Strip in 1959 was a landscape still finding its footing. While the Flamingo, built by Bugsy Siegel, had already established a precedent for lavish entertainment, smaller, stylish motels began to pepper the area, catering to a growing audience. Enter the Flamingo Capri, a 180-room motel erected just beside its namesake. George E. Goldberg and Bill Capri – the latter lending his name to the property – envisioned a modern, comfortable retreat, distinct from the more established casinos. It opened its doors in October 1959, promising a taste of understated elegance. The Capri was designed to be accessible, a step below the full-blown casino experience, offering a more relaxed alternative.

## Shifting Ownership and a Gambler's Vision

Bill Capri’s time with the venture proved short-lived, with George Goldberg eventually becoming the sole owner and operator. The motel thrived, albeit in a relatively quiet corner of the burgeoning Strip. Then, in 1971, Ralph Engelstad, a renowned (and controversial) businessman known for his aggressive casino acquisitions, purchased the Flamingo Capri. Engelstad’s vision was far grander than a simple motel. 

## Casino Dreams and a New Identity: The [Imperial Palace](/posts/imperial-palace-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/)

Engelstad dramatically altered the property’s trajectory. In 1972, a casino was added, transforming the Flamingo Capri into a full-fledged resort. This marked a significant expansion, broadening its appeal and bringing it more firmly into the competitive Las Vegas landscape. Recognizing the need for a rebranding to reflect this transformation, the motel shed its Flamingo Capri identity in 1979 and became the Imperial Palace. The name evoked a sense of grandeur and imperial power—a fitting shift for a casino that was quickly expanding. 

## Best Western Days & the Imperial Palace Tower

The Imperial Palace’s journey continued with further evolution. For a brief period in 1976, it operated under the Best Western banner, a sign of the changing times and a strategy to appeal to a wider range of travelers. However, it quickly returned to independent operation. In 1977, a massive expansion project brought about the iconic 19-story Imperial Palace Tower, instantly doubling the room count from 300 to 650. 

## Legacy & Rebirth: From Imperial Palace to The Linq

The Imperial Palace operated for over three decades, enduring countless changes in the Las Vegas landscape. Ultimately, in 2012, it closed its doors, becoming another casualty of the Strip’s constant evolution. Today, the site that once housed the Flamingo Capri and later the Imperial Palace is home to The Linq Hotel + Experience, a vibrant and modern resort reflecting the continuing reinvention of Las Vegas. While the name and physical structure are gone, the Flamingo Capri’s contribution to the Strip’s early history remains a fascinating chapter in vintage Las Vegas lore.
