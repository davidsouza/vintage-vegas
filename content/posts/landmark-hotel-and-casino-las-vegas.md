# A Dream Deferred: The Story of the Landmark Hotel and Casino

For those of us who cherish vintage Las Vegas, the memory of the Landmark Hotel and Casino represents a bittersweet chapter. Located just off the Strip, in what is now Winchester, Nevada, the Landmark’s story is one of big ambitions, frustrating delays, and ultimately, a failure to thrive in an increasingly competitive landscape. 

## The Caroll Era & Early Challenges (1961-1968)

Frank Caroll, a familiar name in early Vegas gaming, envisioned a grand resort in 1961. He purchased the land and quickly began construction, initially focusing on a shopping center and apartments which opened by the end of 1961. A towering hotel-casino was next, construction beginning in September of the same year. Initial progress was promising, with around 80% of the tower taking shape by 1962. However, funding proved to be a major hurdle, bringing construction to a standstill.

Remarkably, the Central Teamsters Pension Fund stepped in to provide the necessary capital in 1966. This allowed construction to resume, but ownership shifted, and Caroll’s involvement began to wane. The project was plagued by continued delays, culminating in Caroll's withdrawal of his gaming license request in 1968 and the resort being put up for sale.

## The Hughes Years & Country Music Fame (1969-1985)

Howard Hughes, the legendary figure synonymous with Las Vegas expansion, swooped in and purchased the Landmark for a hefty $17.3 million in 1969. Hughes invested heavily in the property, bringing it to completion. The Landmark finally opened its doors with 400 slot machines and 503 hotel rooms. Under Hughes' ownership, the Landmark became known for its live country music performances and celebrity appearances, offering a distinct alternative to the glitz of the Strip’s casinos.

## Decline and Demolition (1985-1995)

Despite the initial success, the Landmark faced relentless pressure from larger, more modern resorts along the Las Vegas Strip. Mounting financial struggles culminated in a bankruptcy filing in 1985. It persevered for a few more years but ultimately shuttered its doors in 1990, unable to compete. 

The Landmark’s legacy isn’t one of lasting grandeur but serves as a reminder of the volatility and rapid evolution of Las Vegas. Purchased by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority in 1993, the Landmark was demolished in 1995, giving way to an expansion of the Las Vegas Convention Center, which opened in 2021. While no physical remains exist, the story of the Landmark remains a compelling chapter in vintage Las Vegas history—a testament to ambition, setbacks, and the relentless pursuit of the Vegas dream.
