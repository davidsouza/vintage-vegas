## A Deli's Legacy & a Firehouse Fantasy

Before the megaresorts and sprawling complexes defined the Las Vegas Strip, there were smaller, more intimate gaming venues. Among them, Foxy’s Firehouse Casino stands out as a particularly charming and memorable piece of vintage Vegas history. Located on the northeast corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and [Sahara](/posts/sahara-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Avenue (now the site of a Walgreens), this little casino operated from 1976 to 1988 and offered a refreshing contrast to the increasingly corporate landscape of the Strip.

The story begins long before the casino’s opening, however. In 1955, Abe “Foxy” Fox opened Foxy’s Deli, a beloved Jewish delicatessen that quickly became a local institution. For years, it served up delicious sandwiches and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. When Fox sold the deli in 1975, the new owners saw an opportunity to transform the space into something new: a casino. Smartly, they retained the familiar “Foxy” name, instantly associating the new venture with a sense of local familiarity.

## The Neon Icon and Casual Charm

What truly set Foxy’s Firehouse apart was its playful, firehouse theme. A massive neon sign depicting a cartoon fox dressed as a fireman quickly became a recognizable landmark for tourists driving down the Strip. Inside, the casino was modest in size, boasting only around 100 slot machines and a small table games pit. However, what it lacked in square footage, it made up for in character. The atmosphere was decidedly unpretentious and welcoming, a holdover from its days as a deli. 

Foxy's Firehouse intentionally avoided competing with the behemoths further down the Strip. Instead, it catered to a local clientele and those seeking a less overwhelming Vegas experience. It was a place where you could comfortably play low-limit games, enjoy casual food, and receive friendly service. This kind of personalized touch was becoming increasingly rare in a city rapidly changing.

## A Lasting Legacy of Simplicity

Though only open for 12 years, Foxy’s Firehouse Casino left a lasting impression. It served as a potent reminder of an earlier, more personable era in Las Vegas history – a time before the dominance of corporate chains and themed resorts. It was a quirky, independently run establishment that added character to the north end of the Strip and provided a unique counterpoint to the extravagance that was becoming the norm. While the neon fox may no longer shine, the memory of Foxy’s Firehouse Casino remains a cherished piece of vintage Las Vegas lore.
