## A Fiery Beginning: The MGM Grand Era (1973-1980)

Bally’s Las Vegas, now Horseshoe, didn't start as Bally’s at all. It began as the MGM Grand in 1973, a sprawling 2,100-room megaresort designed to impress. Its sheer size was a statement – a bold declaration that Las Vegas was serious about big. Think glittering chandeliers, a massive casino floor, and the iconic MGM lion statues proudly displayed everywhere. For a time, it was *the* place to be. However, this era is tragically overshadowed by a devastating fire on November 21, 1980. The blaze, sparked by faulty electrical work, ripped through the casino and lower levels, claiming 85 lives and injuring hundreds. The event remains the deadliest single incident in Nevada's history and fundamentally altered the safety standards for all Las Vegas casinos.

## Rebirth and a New Identity: Bally's Takes Over (1981-1999)

Remarkably, MGM didn't demolish the property. Instead, after an eight-month reconstruction and the implementation of crucial fire safety measures – sprinklers, advanced alarms, and improved exit strategies – the resort reopened in July 1981. The experience, understandably, left a significant mark, but the city rallied.  In 1986, a new chapter began when Bally Manufacturing acquired the resort, shedding the MGM name and embracing a new, vibrant brand. Bally’s Las Vegas was born, ditching the lions for a more playful aesthetic. The property retained its size but adopted a reputation for value and classic casino entertainment.

## The Jubilee! Era and a Classic Strip Experience

Bally’s found its niche as a dependable, centrally-located option. The legendary show *Jubilee!*, which debuted under the MGM Grand banner, became synonymous with Bally’s. Running for over three decades, it was a Vegas institution, a topless spectacular showcasing elaborate costumes and dazzling choreography – a quintessential element of the classic Las Vegas experience. Beyond the show, Bally’s offered a lively casino floor, a variety of dining options, and consistent, if not extravagant, entertainment.

## Parisian Neighbors and Enduring Legacy

The late 90s brought a French-inspired addition with the opening of Paris Las Vegas, cleverly linked to Bally’s via interior corridors. This created a convenient hub for visitors. While newer, themed resorts began dominating the Strip, Bally’s held its own, catering to guests seeking a reliable and affordable option. Refurbishments throughout the 2000s and 2010s kept the property fresh, with the addition of the Grand Bazaar Shops bringing a new retail experience. Though the name is now gone, replaced with Horseshoe, Bally’s Las Vegas’s history remains a vital piece of the Las Vegas Strip’s story—a testament to resilience, reinvention, and the enduring appeal of old-school Vegas charm.
