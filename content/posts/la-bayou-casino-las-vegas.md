## From Coffee House to Coin Castle: A Storied Fremont Street Location

La Bayou Casino, sadly lost to demolition in 2016, occupied a prime spot at 15 East Fremont Street, right on the bustling Fremont Street Experience. But its story goes far deeper than its 17-year run as a casino. The land itself holds a remarkable legacy, starting all the way back in 1913 as the Las Vegas Coffee House. It’s a location intertwined with the very fabric of Las Vegas’s gambling history, becoming the Northern Club in 1920 and famously earning Mayme Stocker the first-ever gaming license in Las Vegas. Through the decades, it’s been known as the Turf Club, Monte Carlo Club, and most memorably, the Coin Castle.

## The Coin Castle Era and Herb Pastor's Vision

For many vintage Las Vegas enthusiasts, the Coin Castle is a cherished memory. Its playful, coin-themed décor was a delightful spectacle and thankfully preserved by the Neon Museum. In 1999, casino veteran Herb Pastor, recognizing the potential and historical significance of the location, stepped in with a $6 million renovation. He completely reimagined the space, transforming it into La Bayou Casino, a whimsical tribute to New Orleans and its vibrant Mardi Gras culture.

## A Unique Vegas Experience: Daiquiris, Coins, and Carnival Games

La Bayou distinguished itself from the rapidly evolving Las Vegas landscape with its unique charm. Unlike many casinos moving toward ticket-based payouts, La Bayou kept it old-school – slot machines dispensed winnings in actual jingling coins! The addition of a daiquiri bar, offering a staggering 26 different flavors, added to the festive atmosphere. A team of dedicated women – true ambassadors of the casino – distributed beads and ran spontaneous mini-games and hourly contest wheel drawings with a top prize of $10,000, creating a lively, carnival-like experience. It was a place where you felt genuinely welcome and entertained.

## A Legacy of Charm, Lost But Not Forgotten

After Herb Pastor, his son Steve Burnstine took over, carefully preserving the essence of La Bayou. The casino’s quirky, nostalgic atmosphere and its commitment to classic gaming resonated with locals and tourists alike. While the Stevens brothers, owners of Golden Gate, The D, and Las Vegas Club, ultimately acquired the property in 2016, integrating the space into an expanded Golden Gate, the loss of La Bayou was felt deeply within the Fremont Street community. It’s a poignant reminder of a simpler, more playful era in Las Vegas, a period that continues to inspire nostalgia and appreciation for the city’s unique history. The coins may be gone, but the memories of La Bayou live on.
