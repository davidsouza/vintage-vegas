## From Coffee House to [Coin Castle](/posts/coin-castle-casino-las-vegas/): A Century of Gaming on Fremont Street

La Bayou Casino, a beloved fixture on Fremont Street, may be gone, but its legacy of quirky fun and old-school Vegas charm lives on. The site’s history stretches back far beyond the 1999 launch of La Bayou itself, tracing its roots to 1913 with the opening of the Las Vegas Coffee House. Can you imagine a fledgling Las Vegas, buzzing with anticipation? That’s the scene surrounding that first iteration! The location quickly evolved, becoming the [Northern Club](/posts/northern-club-las-vegas/) in 1920 – and crucially, earning Mayme Stocker the very first gaming license ever issued in Las Vegas. That makes this one of the most historically significant properties in the city.

## A Colorful Transformation: Turf Club, Monte Carlo & the Coin Castle

Over the decades, the space took on a series of different identities, each leaving its mark on the landscape. It operated as the Turf Club, then the [Monte Carlo Club](/posts/monte-carlo-club-las-vegas/), and finally, as the iconic Coin Castle. The Coin Castle was a spectacle in itself, with a whimsical, coin-themed décor that captured the playful spirit of the era. Sadly, much of its unique design was later preserved by the Neon Museum, a poignant reminder of its vibrant presence.

## La Bayou: A Taste of New Orleans on Fremont

In 1999, Herb Pastor, a seasoned casino veteran, poured $6 million into a complete renovation of the Coin Castle, transforming it into La Bayou. This was no ordinary casino. Pastor wanted to create a lighthearted, immersive experience, and he delivered. The exterior was a delightful homage to New Orleans, complete with Mardi Gras decorations. Inside, a popular daiquiri bar offered a staggering 26 flavors, and the slot machines dispensed payouts in the satisfying jingle of actual coins – a refreshing throwback in an era increasingly dominated by paper vouchers. It was a sensory experience that appealed to nostalgia and a desire for a simpler gaming experience.

## The Lasting Legacy of Fun & Coins

After Pastor’s son, Steve Burnstine, took over ownership in 2006, he wisely maintained the casino's unique character and the dedicated team that made it so special. These weren’t your typical casino staff; women eagerly distributed beads and engaged patrons in spontaneous mini-games and exciting contest wheel drawings offering impressive $10,000 prizes. La Bayou was known for its friendly atmosphere and commitment to classic, coin-based gaming – a feature that increasingly set it apart from its competitors. The 17-year run provided a consistent, reliable experience for locals and tourists alike.

The closure of La Bayou in June 2016 felt like a genuine loss for many in the Las Vegas community.  Acquired by the owners of the [Golden Gate](/posts/golden-gate-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), The D, and [Las Vegas Club](/posts/las-vegas-club-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), the property was integrated into an expanded Golden Gate. While the physical space is now gone, the memory of La Bayou – its playful spirit, its commitment to classic gaming, and its undeniable charm – remains a cherished part of Fremont Street's rich and fascinating history.
