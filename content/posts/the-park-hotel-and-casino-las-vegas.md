## From [Holiday](/posts/holiday-casino-las-vegas/) Cheer to The Park: A Downtown Beginning

Downtown Las Vegas has seen its share of comings and goings. Many hotels and casinos have graced the Fremont Street experience, only to vanish into [the sands](/posts/the-sands-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) of time. Today, we’re revisiting one of those – The Park Hotel and Casino, a property whose life was surprisingly brief, yet packed with significant events in Las Vegas history. Originally opening in 1978 as the [Holiday International](/posts/holiday-international-casino-las-vegas/), the hotel was built near Fremont Street, a key location as downtown remained the heart of Vegas entertainment. The Holiday [International](/posts/international-hotel-las-vegas/) was a significant addition to the area, boasting 406 rooms and aiming to capture the tourist trade that still flocked to the city's original gaming district. It presented a modern, somewhat international aesthetic, fitting with the name and reflecting a broader appeal than some of the more traditionally themed casinos nearby.

## The Strike That Stilled the Doors

The late 1980s were a turbulent time for Las Vegas. A major hotel and casino strike began in 1984, significantly impacting the downtown area. The Holiday International, then operating under the Holiday Inn banner, was among the properties shuttered. The strike lasted for three long years, paralyzing operations and causing considerable financial strain for the owners and employees alike.  This prolonged closure left a visible mark on the downtown landscape, a stark reminder of the contentious relationship between casino owners and the Culinary Union.  The impact extended beyond just the immediate business; it cast a shadow over the perception of downtown Las Vegas, contributing to the shift of focus towards the burgeoning Las Vegas Strip.

## Rebirth as The Park Hotel and Casino (1987-1990)

In 1987, Katsuki Manabe acquired the property and reopened it as The Park Hotel and Casino. While a fresh start, the re-launch didn’t fully overcome the lingering effects of the strike. Manabe attempted to revitalize the property, hoping to recapture some of the former glory of the Holiday International.  The Park featured a more modern, almost upscale feel, compared to some of the more classic themed casinos that defined Fremont Street.  It hosted a variety of entertainment options and aimed to attract a slightly more sophisticated clientele. Unfortunately, despite efforts to reposition the hotel, The Park struggled to gain traction.

## A New Chapter: The Birth of Main Street Station

The Park's time was ultimately short-lived. In 1990, Bob Snow acquired the property, ushering in a new era. Snow’s vision was to create a truly unique experience that honored the city’s railroad history, something that resonated with Las Vegas’ early days as a transportation hub. The hotel was completely renovated and reborn as Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel. Main Street Station, with its working brewery and historic theme, stands today as a successful and beloved fixture of Downtown Las Vegas.  While The Park may have faded into memory, its legacy lives on in the establishment that now occupies its former site, demonstrating the constant evolution and reinvention that defines Las Vegas.
