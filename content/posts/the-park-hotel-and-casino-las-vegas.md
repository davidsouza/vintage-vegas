# The Park Hotel and Casino: A Brief, Turbulent Life Downtown

Downtown Las Vegas boasts a vibrant, albeit sometimes tumultuous, history. Amongst the neon glow and echoes of the past lies the former site of The Park Hotel and Casino, a building that, despite its short lifespan, tells a compelling story of labor disputes, ownership changes, and the evolving landscape of the Vegas Strip. Located at 200 North Main Street, very close to the heart of Fremont Street, The Park (previously the Holiday International) is now occupied by the popular Main Street Station casino, but its legacy remains for those who remember.

## From Holiday Inn to The Park

The story begins in 1978 with the opening of the Holiday International, a 406-room hotel and casino intended to serve as a modern option for visitors near Fremont Street. It was a solid addition to the downtown core, catering to both tourists and locals. However, the hotel's identity underwent a significant shift in 1987 when it was rebranded as The Park, owned by Katsuki Manabe. This name change signaled a slight repositioning, aiming to present a more stylish and appealing image.

## The Strike and the Shutdown

The Park’s existence was tragically cut short by a bitter labor dispute. A hotel strike, beginning in 1984, brought the Holiday International (and later, The Park) to a standstill. The strike, lasting several years, effectively shuttered the property. This period deeply impacted the downtown scene and highlighted the growing pains of Las Vegas's booming hospitality industry.

## A Brief Return, A Definitive End

After a three-year closure, The Park reopened, attempting to resurrect its fortunes. While it offered a glimpse of what could have been, it wasn't enough to overcome the financial strain caused by the prolonged shutdown and the negative perception associated with the strike. The Park officially closed its doors for good in 1990.

## Legacy and Rebirth as Main Street Station

The Park’s legacy is a reminder of the challenges facing Las Vegas’s early casino resorts. It serves as a stark illustration of how labor issues can significantly impact a business's success. Thankfully, the location hasn’t remained dormant. In 1991, it was purchased by Bob Snow, who transformed it into Main Street Station, a casino that successfully embraces the history of the area with its train-themed design and robust community involvement. While The Park is gone, its history lives on, etched within the bricks and mortar of Main Street Station, a testament to the enduring evolution of Downtown Las Vegas.
