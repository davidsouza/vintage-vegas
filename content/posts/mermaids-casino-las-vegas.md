# A Little Slice of Island Life in Downtown Vegas

For years, a little slice of tropical escape existed right on Fremont Street: Mermaids Casino. Though now gone, replaced by the impressive Circa Resort & Casino, Mermaids left a lasting impression on those who frequented downtown Las Vegas. Its story is a microcosm of the area's evolution – a tale of small-scale charm swallowed by big-time development.

## From [Silver Palace](/posts/silver-palace-casino-las-vegas/) to Sassy Sally's: A Building with a Past

But Mermaids wasn't always Mermaids. The building at 32 East Fremont Street had a long and varied history, dating back to 1956 when it debuted as the Silver Palace. This was a significant moment for Vegas, as the Silver Palace was one of the first casinos to feature two levels, a design novelty accentuated by Southern Nevada's first escalator! Over the decades, it wore many faces, including [Carousel](/posts/carousel-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), Gambler's Hall of Fame, [Sundance West](/posts/sundance-west-casino-las-vegas/), and Sassy Sally's – each attempting to capture the era's vibe. The constant rebranding reflects the ever-changing tastes of Vegas visitors and the desire for casino owners to find that elusive winning formula.

## The Mermaids Era: Affordable Fun and Tropical Vibes

In 1999, Herb Pastor brought a new vision to the property, transforming it into Mermaids Casino. He leaned heavily into a tropical, island-themed motif, complete with themed decor, signage, and a distinctly seaside feel. This was a far cry from the glitz and glamour of the Strip. Mermaids focused on simplicity: slots only, a modest 7,000 square feet of gaming space, and a commitment to affordable entertainment. 

What truly set Mermaids apart was its down-to-earth charm. Forget high-roller extravagance; Mermaids catered to everyday players with 99-cent food items, cheap frozen daiquiris, and a full-service bar. The cocktail servers were friendly, the atmosphere relaxed, and the whole place felt like a comfortable neighborhood hangout—a refreshing contrast to the increasingly opulent Strip. Many remember the novelty (and deliciousness!) of deep-fried Twinkies, a true Mermaids signature.

## A Farewell and a Legacy

The inevitable arrived in April 2016 when brothers Derek and Greg Stevens purchased Mermaids, [La Bayou](/posts/la-bayou-casino-las-vegas/), and Girls of [Glitter Gulch](/posts/glitter-gulch-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), signaling the end of an era. The June 27, 2016, closing date marked the beginning of a new chapter for Fremont Street. Mermaids was sadly demolished in 2017, clearing the way for the massive Circa Resort & Casino. While it's bittersweet to see a beloved landmark disappear, Mermaids' story continues to resonate. It serves as a reminder of a time when downtown Las Vegas felt a little more accessible, a little more quirky, and a whole lot more fun.
