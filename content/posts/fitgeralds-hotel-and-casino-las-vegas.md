## From Sundance to Shamrock: The Fitzgeralds Story

Downtown Las Vegas in the 1980s was a landscape of established casinos and burgeoning growth. Perched at the eastern end of Fremont Street, at 301 Fremont Street, stood what began as the Sundance Hotel. This wasn't just any hotel; it was connected to the legendary Moe Dalitz, a name synonymous with Las Vegas history and the Stardust. Initially managed by Al Sachs and Herb Tobman, the Sundance laid the groundwork for what would become a beloved and uniquely themed casino resort.

Then came 1987, and a pivotal change. Lincoln Management Group / Fitzgeralds Gaming purchased the property and gave it a vibrant new identity: Fitzgeralds Las Vegas. Suddenly, the tower was draped in green, adorned with shamrocks, and a mischievous cartoon leprechaun became the casino’s cheerful mascot. This branding wasn't just about aesthetics; it positioned Fitzgeralds as a fun, accessible alternative within a growing downtown market.

## A Downtown Favorite

For years, Fitzgeralds was a staple for locals and tourists alike. The 42,000-square-foot casino floor buzzed with activity – a mix of slots, table games, keno, and a lively sportsbook. Beyond gaming, Fitzgeralds boasted a popular buffet and steakhouse, attracting diners for both casual meals and special occasions. The 34-story tower, one of the tallest on Fremont Street, provided incredible views of the developing canopy and the iconic neon lights, a major draw for guests. It was a value-oriented destination that didn't skimp on entertainment or atmosphere.

## A Changing of the Guard and a New Milestone

The early 2000s brought turbulence. Fitzgeralds Gaming faced bankruptcy, leading to a sale in 2001. This marked a significant moment – Don Barden, a Detroit-based entrepreneur, acquired the property, becoming the first African American to own a casino in Las Vegas. Barden’s investment revitalized Fitzgeralds, with fresh paint, renovations to the buffet and steakhouse, and upgrades to the showroom. His commitment helped stabilize the property during a critical period.

After Barden’s passing, the Stevens brothers, already owners of the Golden Gate, took over in 2011. They embarked on a $22 million renovation, modernizing the casino and rooms. In 2012, the Fitzgeralds name officially retired, giving way to The D Las Vegas. 

## A Legacy Lives On

While the shamrocks and leprechauns are now part of Las Vegas lore, Fitzgeralds' legacy endures. The building, the layout, the very bones of the property live on as The D. For many who frequented Fremont Street during its heyday, Fitzgeralds represents a cherished chapter in Las Vegas history – a time of approachable gaming, quirky theming, and a towering, Irish-themed icon watching over the neon canyon. It’s a reminder of a classic era of downtown Vegas that continues to resonate today.
