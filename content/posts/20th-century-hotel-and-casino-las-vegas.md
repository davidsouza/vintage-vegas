## A Brief, Bright Spark: The 20th Century Hotel & Casino

The Las Vegas Strip is known for its constant evolution, a relentless churn of new resorts and themed experiences. But sometimes, the most fascinating stories are those of places that burned brightly, but didn't last. The 20th Century Hotel & Casino, a short-lived property on Tropicana Avenue between 1977 and 1979, is a perfect example. Its existence – just under two years – speaks volumes about the era and the ever-present gamble inherent in the Vegas dream.

Originally a Howard Johnson’s motel opened in 1973, the property was purchased in 1977 by a New York investment group led by Andrew DeLillo. They envisioned something capturing the optimistic spirit of the 1920s-1940s, a glamorous throwback to the "classic modern" style of the early 20th century. The revamped 300-room resort boasted a casino, buffet, cocktail lounge, live entertainment, and a sparkling pool – the standard amenities for a mid-Strip hotel aiming for a sense of sophisticated fun. 

## Capturing a Fleeting Zeitgeist

The name “20th Century” itself was carefully chosen, evoking a sense of timelessness and nostalgia. It attempted to capitalize on a desire for authenticity in an era where Vegas was increasingly becoming synonymous with glitz and spectacle. While the concept aimed for a nostalgic charm, it faced stiff competition. The late 1970s were seeing the rise of megaresorts like the Mirage and the Luxor – sprawling empires that fundamentally altered the Las Vegas landscape. The 20th Century simply couldn't compete on scale, and struggled to find its niche.

## A Rapid Succession of Reinventions

The original venture ultimately failed. In January 1979, Herb Ross, already a prominent figure in downtown Las Vegas with the Golden Goose and Coin Castle casinos, took over and swiftly rebranded the property as the Treasury Hotel & Casino, abruptly shifting to a country-western theme. This highlights a critical factor in Vegas: pivoting quickly was (and remains) often essential for survival.

The story doesn't end there. The property continued its transformation. Gerry Philbin, a former NFL player, briefly owned it and ran it as a hotel only when casino licensing issues arose. It declared bankruptcy, saw the DeLillo family briefly regain ownership and rename it the Pacifica Hotel, then the Polynesian Hotel. 

## A Testament to Change

Today, the building at 115 E Tropicana Ave. operates as the OYO Hotel & Casino. While the 20th Century Hotel & Casino itself is gone, its legacy endures. It serves as a poignant reminder of the Strip's volatility and its willingness to experiment – and sometimes fail spectacularly – in the pursuit of the next big thing. The rapid rebrandings, the thematic shifts – they're all chapters in a larger story of a city constantly reinventing itself, perpetually chasing the ever-elusive dream of tourist dollars. It's a classic vintage Vegas tale: a brief flash of ambition, a whirlwind of change, and ultimately, a faded memory in the city's rich and vibrant history.
