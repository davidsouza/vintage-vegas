## A Brief Spark of Modernity: The 20th Century Hotel & Casino

The Las Vegas Strip is known for constant reinvention, but few properties exemplify this more dramatically than the site currently occupied by the OYO Hotel & Casino on [Tropicana](/posts/tropicana-country-club-las-vegas/) Avenue. From 1977 to 1979, it was briefly but memorably the 20th Century Hotel & Casino, a venture born from the ashes of a Howard Johnson’s motel and aimed at capturing the spirit of the mid-century modern aesthetic.

The original Howard Johnson’s opened in 1973, a perfectly acceptable, if unremarkable, motel catering to families. But in 1977, a New York investment group led by Andrew DeLillo saw an opportunity. They purchased the property and, with significant renovations, transformed it into the 20th Century Hotel & Casino. The name itself was a deliberate nod to the optimistic and forward-looking vibe of the 1920s, a golden age of design and progress, and a sophisticated brand image for Vegas at the time.

## A Glimpse of What Could Have Been

The 20th Century aimed for a classic, polished glamour. Think sleek lines, stylish cocktail lounges, and live entertainment – the type of sophisticated diversion that appealed to a more discerning clientele. The 300 rooms were redesigned with a modern feel, complementing the casino floor, buffet, and poolside oasis. It wasn’t attempting to be themed like some of its neighbors; instead, it presented a streamlined, sophisticated image reflecting what its owners perceived as an elevated Vegas experience.

## A Short Run & Rapid Transformation

Despite the initial fanfare, the 20th Century struggled. The Las Vegas landscape was rapidly changing, with megaresorts like the [Mirage](/posts/mirage-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) and Luxor looming on the horizon, demanding massive investment and creating fierce competition. In January 1979, just a little over a year after opening, the DeLillo group sold the property to Herb Ross, who dramatically shifted the concept to a country-western theme and rebranded it as [the Treasury](/posts/the-treasury-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Hotel & Casino. This marked the beginning of a whirlwind of name changes and operational shifts, illustrating the often brutal realities of the Las Vegas casino business. 

## Legacy of a Transient Landmark

The 20th Century Hotel & Casino’s legacy isn’t in longevity, but in its embodiment of a fleeting moment in Las Vegas history. It's a microcosm of the era – a time when smaller, independent ventures still had a shot at making a mark on the Strip, before corporate giants dominated the scene. While the name is long gone, the site continues to evolve, showcasing the enduring ability of the Las Vegas Strip to reinvent itself, proving that even short-lived concepts can leave a fascinating mark on the city's ever-changing story.
