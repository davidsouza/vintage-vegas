## From [Royal Inn](/posts/royal-inn-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) to Riverboat Dream

The Las Vegas Strip has seen its share of themed hotels, but few were as delightfully odd as the Paddlewheel Hotel and Casino. Located at 305 Convention Center Drive, its story begins in 1970 as the [Royal](/posts/royal-casino-las-vegas/) Inn and Casino. While a perfectly respectable property, the Royal Inn lacked the star power to truly make a [splash](/posts/splash-las-vegas/) on the burgeoning Strip.  That all changed in the early 1980s. A savvy investment group, including executives from the famed Horn & Hardart coffee and vending machine empire, acquired the property, envisioning something entirely different.

## A Floating Fantasy - The Paddlewheel Debuts

November 21, 1983, marked the official unveiling of the Paddlewheel Hotel and Casino. The transformation was significant. The exterior was reimagined to resemble a massive paddlewheel riverboat, complete with faux smokestacks and a vaguely nautical theme. It was a bold statement, harkening back to the romanticized era of steamboats on the Mississippi.  Initially, the Paddlewheel catered to families. Arcades buzzed with the sounds of Pac-Man and Donkey Kong, and small amusement rides kept younger guests entertained. It was a deliberate attempt to capture a broader demographic, a rarity for Strip properties at the time which often targeted a more adult audience. 

## Shifting [Sands](/posts/sands-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/): From Family Fun to Male Revues

Like many Las Vegas properties, the Paddlewheel underwent a significant shift in its identity. Recognizing a changing market, the family-friendly atmosphere gradually gave way to a more adult-oriented focus.  Male revues, a staple of Vegas entertainment, became a prominent feature, attracting a different kind of clientele.  This evolution reflected the Strip's ongoing pursuit of entertainment innovation and catering to evolving tastes.

## A Short But Memorable Voyage

Despite its unique concept and initial popularity, the Paddlewheel's time on the Strip proved relatively brief. Horn & Hardart, facing financial challenges of their own, put the property up for sale in 1990.  The hotel ultimately closed its doors in October 1991, leaving behind a legacy of quirky charm and a faint echo of riverboat nostalgia. At the time of closure, it had 300 slot machines and just four table games - a far cry from the sprawling casinos of today.



## What Remains & The Future of the Site

Today, the land sits vacant, a reminder of a bygone era. Developer Lorenzo Doumani acquired the property and has long planned to construct a high-rise, non-gaming hotel called Majestic Las Vegas. While plans have been announced repeatedly, construction delays have plagued the project, leaving the site dormant and fueling speculation.  The Paddlewheel Hotel and Casino may be gone, but its memory lives on as a quirky footnote in Las Vegas’s vibrant and ever-changing history—a testament to the Strip's willingness to embrace the unusual and the ephemeral.
