## From [Royal Inn](/posts/royal-inn-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) to Riverboat Dream: The Paddlewheel's Genesis

Few Las Vegas properties evoke quite the nostalgic pangs as the Paddlewheel Hotel and Casino. Located at 305 Convention Center Drive (now destined for the Majestic Las Vegas high-rise), its story began in 1970 as the [Royal](/posts/royal-casino-las-vegas/) Inn and Casino. For years, it existed as a relatively unassuming fixture on Convention Center Drive, quietly serving a clientele largely connected to the nearby convention center. However, the 1980s brought a dramatic makeover and a radical change of identity.

In 1983, a new investment group, including influential executives from the Horn & Hardart coffee and food service empire, stepped in. They envisioned something different – a family-friendly resort evoking the charm of a Mississippi paddlewheel riverboat. The Royal Inn was rebranded as the Paddlewheel Hotel and Casino, complete with a distinctive nautical theme and a playful atmosphere.

## A Family-Friendly Focus (and a Shift in Direction)

The early Paddlewheel catered significantly to families. Arcades buzzed with the sounds of electronic games, and amusement rides provided entertainment for children. The casino floor, while present, wasn’t the primary draw. This was a very different approach to the burgeoning Las Vegas Strip, which was increasingly targeting adult gamblers. 

However, business strategies evolve. Recognizing a potential shift in market demand (and likely facing profitability challenges), the Paddlewheel underwent a significant evolution. The family-friendly elements began to recede, replaced by a more adult-oriented entertainment experience. This transformation included the introduction of male revue shows, a move common amongst Las Vegas hotels at the time seeking to attract a different demographic.

## A Brief but Memorable Run and an Uncertain Future

Despite the changes, the Paddlewheel's time on the Strip proved to be relatively brief. By 1990, Horn & Hardart decided to divest and put the property up for sale. The hotel officially closed its doors in October 1991, leaving behind a collection of 300 slot machines and just four table games. While not a long-running landmark, the Paddlewheel became a memorable piece of Las Vegas history, representing a unique moment in time when a riverboat theme and family entertainment attempted to carve a niche in the ever-evolving landscape of the Strip. 

Today, the land sits vacant, awaiting the realization of developer Lorenzo Doumani’s Majestic Las Vegas project. Numerous delays have plagued that development, highlighting the challenges of bringing new construction to a city steeped in legacy. Still, the Paddlewheel's memory lives on, a testament to the constant reinvention and fleeting moments that define the vibrant history of Las Vegas.
