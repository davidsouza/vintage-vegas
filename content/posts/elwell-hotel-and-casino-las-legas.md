## A Family Legacy on First and Carson

Before the mega-resorts and dazzling marquees, Las Vegas was a town built on family, grit, and a little bit of luck. One such testament to that early era was the Elwell Hotel, a modest but significant contributor to the city’s burgeoning hospitality scene. Located at the intersection of First Street and Carson Avenue, a spot that now holds a Golden Nugget parking garage, the Elwell’s story is one of local roots, civic involvement, and a bittersweet evolution of the Las Vegas Strip.

The Elwell’s story began long before 1951, the year the hotel officially opened. The land itself was part of a larger tract owned by the Elwell family, descendants of early Las Vegas settlers. William Elwell, along with his two sisters, Naomi Uptigrove and Doris Brown, decided to put the family’s land to use, constructing a hotel to cater to the increasing number of visitors drawn to the city’s gambling and entertainment opportunities.  It was a family venture, deeply embedded in the fabric of the community.

## The Elwell Hotel: A Simple Charm

The Elwell Hotel, initially a smaller establishment, represented a simpler time in Las Vegas. It wasn’t flashy or extravagant, but it offered clean rooms and a convenient location.  The building itself was a functional, unpretentious structure, reflective of the post-war American aesthetic.  In 1954, recognizing the growing demand, the Elwell family expanded the hotel, adding rooms to bring its total to 117.  This expansion signaled the hotel’s growing success and its increasing importance in the local lodging market. 

William Elwell himself was a prominent figure, actively involved in the community. He served as a regent for the University of Nevada and as a city commissioner, demonstrating his commitment to Las Vegas’s development.  This civic engagement further cemented the Elwell family’s place in the city's history.

## From Hotel to Casino, and a Quick Demise

While initially just a hotel, the Elwell eventually transitioned to include casino gaming, reflecting the changing landscape of Las Vegas. However, its time as the Elwell Hotel & Casino was relatively short-lived. In 1965, the property was sold to the Pioneer Club for a respectable $1.5 million. The hotel was promptly rebranded as the Pioneer Hotel, taking on a more Western theme that became synonymous with the early Las Vegas Strip.

## A Parking Garage, a Lost Memory

Sadly, the Elwell’s legacy wouldn't last much longer. In 1984, the Golden Nugget, ever expanding its footprint, purchased the Pioneer Hotel property. The building, once a symbol of the Elwell family's contribution to Las Vegas, was demolished to make way for a parking garage – a stark reminder of how the city relentlessly chases progress and often sacrifices its historic landmarks in the process. 

While the Elwell Hotel & Casino is physically gone, its story remains a valuable piece of vintage Las Vegas history, a testament to the entrepreneurial spirit of early settlers and a reminder of a simpler, yet equally captivating, era in the city's evolution.
