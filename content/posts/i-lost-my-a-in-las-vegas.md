## A Matchbook Mystery: "I Lost My A in Las Vegas"

Finding truly unique ephemera from vintage Las Vegas is a thrill for any collector. Recently, we came across a curious piece: a matchbook emblazoned with the playful phrase "I Lost My A in Las Vegas."  It’s a simple statement, hinting at a certain type of escapism and perhaps, a little bit of playful recklessness – hallmarks of the Las Vegas experience, especially in the 1970s. What makes this matchbook particularly fascinating is its rarity and the list of participating hotels it features.

## A Star-Studded List of Sponsors

The "I Lost My A" matchbook wasn’t just a whimsical giveaway. It was a co-sponsored promotional piece, meaning a collection of Las Vegas hotels pooled their resources to distribute it. Looking at the list of venues—Union Plaza, Sahara, Desert Inn, Riviera, Flamingo, MGM Grand, Dunes, Hacienda, Circus Circus, Sands, Las Vegas Hilton, Frontier Hotel, Aladdin, Caesars Palace, Stardust, and Tropicana—is like staring at a who’s who of the Las Vegas Strip’s golden age. Most of these properties are legendary, though many have sadly disappeared or been rebranded over the years. 

Think about it: the Sahara, once a sprawling playground owned by Herbert and Lois Goodman; the Desert Inn, Howard Hughes’ opulent first foray into the Vegas landscape; the Dunes, whose implosion in 1996 paved the way for Bellagio. Each of these hotels represented a distinct era and style of Las Vegas entertainment.  The matchbook serves as a snapshot in time, capturing a moment when these establishments were all vying for attention and a piece of the gambling pie.

## The 1970s: Excess and Entertainment

The 1970s in Las Vegas were defined by unapologetic extravagance. It was the era of enormous hotel-casinos, glitzy showrooms packed with headlining performers (think Elvis, Liberace, and Tom Jones), and a loosening of regulations that fueled rapid expansion. "I Lost My A" perfectly embodies the spirit of this period.  It’s cheeky, suggestive, and speaks to the perception of Las Vegas as a place where inhibitions were shed and fortunes (and perhaps, a bit more) could be lost.

While the exact origin and specific timeframe for this promotion remain somewhat of a mystery, the design aesthetic and the list of participating venues strongly suggest a mid-to-late 1970s timeframe. It's a tangible reminder of a Vegas that was simultaneously luxurious, chaotic, and undeniably captivating.

## An Echo of the Past

The existence of this matchbook, along with its less-known counterpart bearing the tagline "I Made It Big in Las Vegas", provides a fascinating window into the promotional strategies of the era. It demonstrates the collaborative spirit amongst these hotels and the desire to cultivate a specific image for Las Vegas as a destination.  While its connection to the "I Made It Big" matchbook remains unconfirmed, the shared playful tone points to a coordinated effort.
