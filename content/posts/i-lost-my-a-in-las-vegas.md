# “I Lost My A in Las Vegas”: A Matchbook Mystery

Vintage Las Vegas is full of ephemera – cocktail napkins, playing cards, show programs – that offer fleeting glimpses into a bygone era. Among the most intriguing of these relics is a promotional matchbook bearing the cryptic phrase, “I Lost My A in Las Vegas.” Its mystery deepens the further you dig, offering a unique window into the 1970s, a decade of immense change and extravagant growth for the Las Vegas Strip.

## The Matchbook & Its Magnificent Sponsors

The matchbook itself isn't a work of fine art, but its value lies in the institutions it represents. It’s a co-sponsored promotional piece, meaning a group of hotels banded together to distribute it. And what a group! Participating venues included a veritable who’s-who of classic Vegas: the Union Plaza, [Sahara](/posts/sahara-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), [Desert Inn](/posts/desert-inn-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) (long since demolished, but a crucial early player), [Riviera](/posts/riviera-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), Flamingo, MGM Grand (the original, of course), [Dunes](/posts/dunes-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) (another gone but not forgotten landmark), [Hacienda](/posts/hacienda-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), Circus Circus, [Sands](/posts/sands-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) (famously imploded to make way for The Venetian), [Las Vegas Hilton](/posts/las-vegas-hilton-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), [Frontier](/posts/frontier-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Hotel, [Aladdin](/posts/aladdin-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), Caesars Palace, [Stardust](/posts/stardust-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), and [Tropicana](/posts/tropicana-country-club-las-vegas/). 

This list alone is a travelogue through Las Vegas history. Each of these hotels contributed to the unique identity of the Strip, from the sophisticated glamour of Caesars to the family-friendly chaos of Circus Circus. The sheer number of participants suggests a wide-ranging promotional campaign intended to reach a broad audience.

## What Does "I Lost My A" Even Mean?

The phrase itself is the ultimate head-scratcher. Theories abound, and no definitive explanation has surfaced. Some speculate it's a playful reference to losing money – an ‘A’ representing a significant amount – at the casinos. Others suggest it’s a cheeky nod to lost status or reputation. Considering the era, it's possible the “A” represents a grade – perhaps an academic failure overcome by the allure of Vegas, a playful twist on escaping responsibility. The ambiguity is part of its charm.

## A Companion Piece & Lingering Questions

Adding to the intrigue is the existence of another matchbook cover which states, "I made it big in Las Vegas." Whether or not this was part of the same promotion remains unknown, creating an interesting visual contrast and sparking further speculation about the campaign's overall theme. Was it a duality of Vegas experiences—the potential for loss and the promise of success? 

The mystery surrounding both matchbooks highlights the fragmented nature of Vegas history. Many details about promotional campaigns from the 70s are simply lost to time. If anyone possesses information regarding this promotion’s origin, sponsors or intended message, we would love to hear from you! It’s a fascinating puzzle piece in the larger picture of vintage Las Vegas.
