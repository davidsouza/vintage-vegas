## A Slice of Early Fremont Street: The Bonanza Lodge

Downtown Las Vegas’s Fremont Street Experience is a whirlwind of light and sound today, but it wasn’t always that way. Before the soaring Viva Vision canopy, before the casinos expanded to encompass entire blocks, Fremont Street was a street slowly evolving into the “Glitter Gulch” we know—and the Bonanza Lodge stood as a quiet observer of that transformation. Located at 1808 Fremont Street, this modest motel offers a tangible glimpse into Las Vegas’s mid-century lodging scene.

## Birth of a Motor Court (1947)

The Bonanza Lodge opened its doors in 1947, a pivotal year for Las Vegas. Post-war prosperity fueled an influx of visitors, largely motorists eager to experience the burgeoning gambling scene. Back then, Fremont Street was still finding its footing, and the Bonanza Lodge catered directly to this wave of travelers. It was a classic motor court – simple guest rooms, convenient on-site parking, and a prime location within walking distance of the neon-lit casinos springing up along the street. These were the days when a room cost significantly less than today, and the focus was on providing a comfortable, accessible base for exploring the city's entertainment.

## The Neon Sign and Growing Identity

By the mid-1950s, the Bonanza Lodge added its own sparkle to Fremont Street with a distinctive neon sign. This wasn't just an advertisement; it became a visual marker, contributing to the street’s evolving character. Imagine it, amidst the other bright signs, a beacon for weary travelers searching for a place to rest. A beautiful 1986 slide of this sign is preserved in the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Special Collections, a testament to its significance and a valuable resource for researchers interested in Las Vegas neon history.

## The Inevitable Evolution – and Rebranding

Like many smaller motels and lodges on Fremont Street, the Bonanza Lodge’s independent identity eventually succumbed to the pressures of Las Vegas's relentless growth. The city’s relentless drive for larger-scale resorts and redevelopment schemes meant that smaller, locally-owned establishments frequently found themselves absorbed. In 2014, the Bonanza Lodge met this fate, merging with its neighbor, the Purple Sage Motel, and being rebranded as the “Sterling Gardens” property.

## A Legacy of Simplicity and Affordability

While the Bonanza Lodge itself no longer exists as a separate entity, its legacy endures. It’s a reminder of a different era in Las Vegas, a time when affordability and proximity to the action were paramount.  It represents a vital layer in the city’s complex lodging landscape - a transition from the early roadside motels to the mega-resorts that define modern Las Vegas. Today, Sterling Gardens Hotel occupies the site at 1808 Fremont, but the memory of the Bonanza Lodge remains a valuable touchstone for those studying the architectural and neon history of early Las Vegas.
