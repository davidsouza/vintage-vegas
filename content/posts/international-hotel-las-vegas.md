## A Vision Takes Root (and Almost Doesn't)

The story of the International Hotel is more than just about a building; it's a tale of ambition, rivalry, and the relentless expansion of Las Vegas. The land, originally part of the Las Vegas Park racetrack, sat far enough east of the Strip in the 1960s that it was considered a risky location. In 1965, Marvin Kratter, of National Equities, first envisioned a massive resort complex, complete with a 1,500-room hotel, a golf course, and private residences. However, Kratter's vision remained unrealized.

Enter Kirk Kerkorian, the aviation mogul and a man known for his audacious bets. In 1967, he swooped in and purchased a substantial 65.5-acre portion of Kratter’s land for $5 million.  Kerkorian's plan was even grander: a 1,510-room, 30-story hotel costing $50 million. He named it the International Hotel, cleverly mirroring Kratter’s previously planned "International Country Club" and signaling his intention to create a "second Strip" along [Paradise](/posts/paradise-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Road.

## The Hughes Factor & a Race to the Finish

Kerkorian wasn't building in a vacuum. Howard Hughes, already a significant player in Las Vegas with his [Sands](/posts/sands-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Hotel, saw Kerkorian as a direct competitor. Hughes launched a series of attempts to derail the International's construction. These included expanding his own Sands to challenge its scale, spreading rumors about nuclear test site damage potentially impacting the area, and even offering to buy the property outright. All failed. 

The rivalry reached a fever pitch.  Hughes, unable to stop the International, accelerated the construction of the unfinished [Landmark Hotel and Casino](/posts/landmark-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) directly across Paradise Road.  The Landmark opened a single day *before* the International, a petty victory in a fierce battle.

## An Era of Entertainment & Elvis

Despite the drama, the International Hotel officially opened on July 2, 1969.  At 30 stories, it was instantly the tallest building in Nevada and the state's largest hotel. Entertainment director Bill Miller quickly secured star power, signing the likes of Barbra Streisand and Peggy Lee. But the biggest coup was yet to come: Elvis Presley. The King of Rock 'n' Roll began his groundbreaking seven-year run on July 31, 1969, performing an astonishing 636 consecutive sold-out shows.  This residency was a massive draw, although it undoubtedly eclipsed the opportunities of other performers who’d previously graced the International’s stages.

## From Financial Troubles to a New Name

The International’s success was tempered by Kerkorian’s ever-present financial juggling. By late 1969, he found himself needing $29 million to cover debts related to his involvement in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Western Airlines. A stock offering was rejected by the SEC, leaving Kerkorian in a precarious position.  

In 1971, he sold International Leisure, the holding company for the International Hotel and the Flamingo, to Hilton Hotels. The International Hotel was swiftly renamed the [Las Vegas Hilton](/posts/las-vegas-hilton-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), a name that would become synonymous with Vegas entertainment.  Hilton gained full ownership in 1972.

## A Lasting Legacy

Today, the building stands as Westgate Las Vegas, a testament to Kerkorian’s vision and the ever-evolving landscape of the Las Vegas Strip. While the name has changed, the spirit of innovation and grand ambition that defined the International Hotel remains, a vital chapter in vintage Las Vegas history.
