## A Vision Beyond the Strip

Before the Westgate Las Vegas, before even the Las Vegas Hilton, stood the International Hotel, a monument to Kirk Kerkorian's ambitious vision for the burgeoning Las Vegas landscape. The story begins not with grand designs, but with a racetrack – the Las Vegas Park. In 1965, real estate developer Marvin Kratter initially acquired the land, envisioning a sprawling development complete with a hotel, golf course, and luxury homes. However, his plans didn't fully materialize, leaving a prime piece of real estate ripe for a new opportunity.

That opportunity fell to Kirk Kerkorian, the aviation and entertainment titan. In 1967, Kerkorian purchased 65.5 acres for a cool $5 million, intending to build a colossal 1,510-room, 30-story hotel – a bold move for its time, as it was significantly removed from the established Las Vegas Strip. Kerkorian’s goal was audacious: to create a “second Strip” along Paradise Road. He cleverly mirrored Kratter’s pre-existing “International Country Club” with the hotel’s name, solidifying his claim on the developing area.

## A Rivalry and a Race to Open

Kerkorian’s aggressive expansion didn't sit well with everyone. Howard Hughes, already a powerful player in Las Vegas casinos, saw Kerkorian as a direct competitor. Hughes attempted to sabotage the International Hotel's construction through various means, including expanding the Sands Hotel and spreading disinformation about potential nuclear test damage. He even tried, unsuccessfully, to buy and shut down the project entirely. In a dramatic turn of events, Hughes instead completed and opened the Landmark Hotel and Casino *across* the street from the International just one day before Kerkorian’s grand opening.

## A Reign of Entertainment and Financial Strain

The International Hotel officially opened on July 2, 1969, instantly becoming Nevada’s tallest building and largest hotel. Kerkorian pulled out all the stops, securing headlining acts like Barbra Streisand and Peggy Lee. However, the most significant entertainment milestone came with Elvis Presley’s residency, beginning July 31, 1969. Elvis's seven-year run, encompassing an astounding 636 sold-out performances, cemented the International’s status as a premier entertainment destination and overshadowed many of its predecessor performers.

Despite the success, financial troubles soon surfaced. Kerkorian's investment in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Western Airlines left him needing $29 million. A stock offering was rejected, forcing him to sell International Leisure to Hilton Hotels in 1971. The property was then rebranded as the Las Vegas Hilton, and Hilton acquired full ownership in 1972. 

## Legacy and Rebirth

Today, the International Hotel’s legacy lives on as the Westgate Las Vegas. While the name and exterior have changed, the spirit of ambition and innovation that defined the International Hotel – a gamble that dared to challenge the conventions of Las Vegas – remains a fascinating chapter in vintage Las Vegas history.
