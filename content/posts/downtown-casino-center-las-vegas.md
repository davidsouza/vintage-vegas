## A Bold Brand for Glitter Gulch: Introducing Downtown Casino Center

Everyone recognizes the “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” sign, but do you know the story behind “Downtown Casino Center”? Back in 1959, Las Vegas needed a boost. The burgeoning Las Vegas Strip was starting to draw attention away from the vibrant, neon-soaked heart of the city: Fremont Street. To combat this, a clever branding campaign was launched – not for a single casino, but for the entire district. The goal? To create a memorable identity for what was then known as “Glitter Gulch.”

The name itself came from a civic contest, rewarding the winning entry with a cool $500 (a significant sum back then!). Mayor Oran Gragson wasn’t initially sold on “Casino Center,” but admitted it was a marked improvement over the alternative. To visually announce the new identity, the city commissioned a spectacular roadside sign on the Strip, a neon masterpiece crafted by Western Neon and the brilliant Betty Willis (who also designed the iconic Welcome sign). The sign declared “Downtown Casino Center → 10 Minutes,” a clear directive pointing visitors towards the classic Vegas experience.

## More Than a Name: Defining Downtown’s Core

“Downtown Casino Center” wasn’t just a catchy moniker; it represented a geographic area centered around the intersection of Fremont Street and Casino Center Boulevard. This bustling crossroads, anchored by legendary casinos like the Golden Nugget, the Horseshoe (now Binion’s), the Fremont, and later the Four Queens, became the quintessential postcard view of Downtown. This area, now often referred to as the "four corners," embodied the dense, walkable casino canyon that defined the era.

In a powerful move that truly embedded the brand into the city’s fabric, Second Street was officially renamed Casino Center Boulevard in 1965. This cemented the concept, visually marking the district’s identity on the map.

## A Fading Brand, an Enduring Legacy

While the “Downtown Casino Center” label faded from prominence in the 1970s, overshadowed by the rise of megaresorts on the Strip, its impact remains. The street name, Casino Center Boulevard, persists, serving as a powerful reminder of vintage Las Vegas. It's a touchstone for those seeking the glow of classic Fremont.

Ultimately, Downtown Casino Center was more than just a branding campaign; it was a promise. A promise of a unique, vibrant experience, where you could stroll from dazzling marquee to dazzling marquee under a canopy of neon.  That promise, in many ways, lives on today within the Fremont Street Experience, continuing to draw visitors to the heart of vintage Las Vegas.
