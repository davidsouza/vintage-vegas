## Remembering Downtown Casino Center: More Than Just a Name

Everyone recognizes the "Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas" sign. But few know about the equally ambitious, though ultimately faded, branding effort that accompanied it: Downtown Casino Center. Launched in 1959, it wasn't a casino itself, but a bold attempt to solidify Fremont Street's identity as *the* place to be in Las Vegas. It represented a crucial moment in Las Vegas history, a deliberate effort to compete with the burgeoning Strip, which was starting to develop its own distinct appeal.

## The Birth of a Brand

The concept arose from a “Name Downtown” contest – a civic promotion to differentiate the Fremont Street area, then known as “[Glitter Gulch](/posts/glitter-gulch-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/),” from the developing resorts further out on the road. The winning entry, "Downtown Casino Center," secured its creator $500 (a significant sum at the time!). Mayor Oran Gragson, while initially hesitant, admitted it was a better name than “Glitter Gulch,” signifying the city's commitment to a recognizable brand.

To reinforce the message, the city commissioned two neon signs from Western Neon, designed by the legendary Betty Willis (also the artist behind the iconic "Welcome" sign). One, dramatically positioned on the Strip, proclaimed “Downtown Casino Center → 10 Minutes,” acting as a directional beacon. A second sign was placed closer to downtown. These weren’t just signs; they were promises – a swift route to the heart of classic Las Vegas.

## The Heart of Old Las Vegas

Geographically, Downtown Casino Center centered around the intersection of Fremont Street and Casino Center Boulevard, which now stands as a direct legacy of the branding campaign. The area, often referred to as the “four corners,” was a densely packed cluster of iconic casinos including the Golden Nugget, the [Horseshoe](/posts/horseshoe-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) (now Binion’s), the Fremont, and later, the Four Queens. It represented a uniquely walkable and immersive casino experience—a far cry from the sprawling megaresorts that would soon dominate the Strip. Visitors could easily transition from one dazzling marquee to another, enveloped in the sights and sounds of vintage Vegas.

## A Fleeting Legacy

The branding’s culmination arrived in 1965 when Second Street officially became Casino Center Boulevard, cementing the campaign’s impact on the city’s landscape. However, by the 1970s, the Downtown Casino Center label began to fade, eclipsed by the rise of the Strip’s increasingly extravagant megaresorts. The marketing landscape shifted, and downtown struggled to maintain its dominance. 

Despite its disappearance from active promotional materials, the name “Casino Center Boulevard” remains—a tangible reminder of a specific era in Las Vegas history. It's a place name that instantly evokes images of neon-drenched streets, the clatter of slot machines, and the vibrant energy of classic Fremont Street. In a fascinating way, the spirit of Downtown Casino Center lives on today within the Fremont Street Experience, echoing the promise of a concentrated, immersive Vegas experience that originally defined the area.
