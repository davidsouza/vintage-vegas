## A Brief, Brilliant Spark: The Birth of Glitter Gulch

The 1980s Las Vegas Strip was a landscape of bold ambition and frantic development. Amidst the burgeoning skyline, Bob Stupak envisioned a casino unlike any other – and thus, Glitter Gulch Hotel and Casino was born in 1980. The name itself conjured images of the original, dusty strip, a “glittering gulch” carved out of the desert. It wasn't meant to be a grand, opulent resort; Stupak's plan was more focused on offering a lively, energetic gaming experience. He offered standard table games - slots, Blackjack, Poker, and Craps - and sought to create a bustling, friendly atmosphere that would appeal to a wider range of gamblers.

However, Stupak’s attention was rapidly shifting. He was heavily invested in his massive Stratosphere Tower project, which would soon become a landmark. The demands of building such an ambitious structure consumed his time and resources, leaving little room to nurture Glitter Gulch. By 1981, he’d essentially moved on, signaling the casino’s first chapter was nearing its end.

Enter Herb Pastor, a casino owner who already operated the Golden Goose Casino next door. In 1982, Pastor acquired Glitter Gulch, merging it with his existing property. This combined operation offered a slightly larger footprint and a more stable footing, allowing it to continue operating. For nearly a decade, the Golden Goose/Glitter Gulch combination served as a mid-Strip option, a little less flashy than the giants but still retaining a distinct Vegas vibe.

The joint venture wasn’t striving for high-roller glamour. It catered to a loyal, consistent crowd seeking a casual and welcoming gaming environment. The era was characterized by a mix of established Vegas staples and newer, more flamboyant casinos – Glitter Gulch found its niche in that bustling scene.

## From Glitter Gulch to Girls, and Ultimately, Circa

After Pastor sold the property, the casino took on yet another identity: the Girls of Glitter Gulch. While it maintained the legacy of its predecessors, the change represented a distinct shift in branding, a final attempt to draw a new clientele. Sadly, this proved unsustainable. The Girls of Glitter Gulch closed its doors in 2016.

Today, the location stands transformed. Circa Resort & Casino, a modern sportsbook-focused resort, occupies the space. While the name “Glitter Gulch” has faded from the Strip, its brief but bright existence remains a fascinating footnote in the history of vintage Las Vegas, a reminder of the ever-evolving landscape and the relentless pursuit of the next big thing on the Las Vegas Strip. It stands as a symbol of the quick pace of change and the innovative spirit that helped shape Las Vegas into what it is today.
