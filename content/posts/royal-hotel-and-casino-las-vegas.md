## A Convention-Focused Beginning

The Las Vegas Strip, for all its glitz and grandeur, isn't solely built on high-roller gamblers. A significant portion of Vegas's economic engine relies on the thriving convention industry. The Royal Hotel and Casino, located at 99 Convention Center Drive, just east of the Strip and adjacent to the Las Vegas Convention Center, understood this from the very beginning. Opening in 1970 as the Royal Las Vegas, it was initially part of the Royal Executive Inns chain, a group focused on providing reliable and affordable lodging for business travelers. Unlike its flashier neighbors, the Royal wasn't vying for the attention of the casual tourist; it aimed to be the dependable home base for convention attendees and business professionals.

## From Hotel to Casino and Back

The early 1970s saw a significant shift for the Royal. Recognizing the potential for additional revenue, a small casino was added around 1973. This rebranding as the Royal Casino was a subtle one, maintaining the hotel's core identity while offering a modest gaming experience. Don't expect sprawling, opulent gaming floors here. Reports suggest the casino footprint was relatively small, sometimes featuring just around 100 slot machines and a couple of blackjack tables. This wasn't about attracting serious gamblers; it was about offering a convenient, low-key option for those spending their days at conventions. 

The 1990s brought another name change, solidifying its identity as the Royal Hotel and Casino.  Through the decades, it carved out a niche – affordable, convention-focused lodging with a small casino. It served a purpose, a reliable, economical option for those who didn’t want the extravagance (and price tag) of the Strip’s more famous properties.

## A Quiet Endurance and Eventual Decline

Around 2003, the casino quietly closed its doors, and the hotel function became the primary focus. The property eventually re-emerged as the Royal Resort, signifying a complete shift away from gaming. For years, it continued to serve its core clientele, a dependable presence near the convention center. 

Sadly, the Royal’s story took a tragic turn in 2022 when a fire on the seventh floor triggered the building’s sprinkler system, causing extensive water damage. While attempts were made to salvage the property, the damage proved too extensive. Now, in mid-2025, a liquidation sale signaled the end of an era, paving the way for demolition. 

## A Legacy of Quiet Service

The Royal Hotel and Casino, in its various iterations, represents a quieter chapter in Las Vegas history. It wasn't a landmark of extravagance, but a testament to the vital role conventions play in the city's economy. It served a specific purpose, offering affordable lodging and a touch of gaming convenience to a clientele often overlooked by the Strip's glitzier offerings. While its physical presence is soon to be gone, its legacy of quiet endurance and modest reinvention remains a small, but important, piece of vintage Las Vegas history.
