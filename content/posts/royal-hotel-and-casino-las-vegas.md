## A Convention-Focused Beginning (1970-1973)

Just east of the dazzling Las Vegas Strip, nestled near the bustling Las Vegas Convention Center, stood the Royal Hotel and Casino. Its story begins in 1970 as the “Royal Las Vegas,” part of the Royal Executive Inns chain. Unlike its glamorous neighbors, the Royal wasn't vying for the high-roller crowd. Instead, it strategically targeted the burgeoning convention and business travel market, a crucial and often overlooked engine of Vegas’s early growth. The original concept prioritized practicality and affordability, offering a clean, convenient lodging option for those attending trade shows and conferences – a far cry from the opulent themed resorts starting to dominate the Strip.

## Adding a Touch of Gaming (1973 - 1990s)

Around 1973, the Royal shifted direction slightly, adding a modest casino. Rebranded as the Royal Casino, this wasn't a grand, sprawling gaming floor. Think roughly 100 slot machines and a couple of blackjack tables – a quiet gaming experience catering to the hotel's existing clientele. It was never meant to be a destination casino itself, but rather an added amenity for guests. The property successfully balanced its hotel function with this small but functional casino operation for decades.

## Name Changes & The Focus on Lodging (1990s - 2003)

The early 1990s brought another name change: The Royal Hotel and Casino. However, the casino’s footprint remained small, reflecting the ongoing strategy of serving the convention traffic first and foremost. In 2003, a significant shift occurred; the casino portion closed its doors entirely. The Royal transitioned completely to a hotel, becoming the Royal Resort. This marked a return to its original roots, emphasizing convenience and affordability for convention attendees.

## A Quiet Endurance and a Tragic End (2003 - 2025)

For two decades, the Royal Resort remained a dependable option, quietly serving its purpose alongside the ever-evolving Las Vegas landscape. It carved out a vital niche, offering a cost-effective alternative to the extravagant Strip resorts. Then, in 2022, a fire on the seventh floor triggered the building’s sprinkler system, causing extensive water damage. This event ultimately proved insurmountable, forcing the hotel’s closure and preventing a full operational recovery.

Now, in mid-2025, the Royal Resort is undergoing a liquidation sale, signaling its impending demolition. Its legacy isn't one of flash or fanfare. It's a story of quiet endurance, modest reinventions, and a steadfast commitment to supporting Las Vegas’s business and convention infrastructure. The Royal at 99 Convention Center Drive – a humble player in the grand Vegas narrative – is quietly fading away, making room for the next chapter in the city’s relentless evolution.
