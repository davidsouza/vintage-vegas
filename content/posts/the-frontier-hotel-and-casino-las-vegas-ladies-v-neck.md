## From [Frontier](/posts/frontier-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) to New Frontier: A Wild West Beginning

[The Frontier Hotel and Casino](/posts/the-frontier-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), originally just “The Frontier Hotel,” burst onto the Las Vegas Strip in 1942. Built on the site of the former Spanish saddle shop, it was envisioned as a western-themed resort mirroring the romanticized image of the American frontier. Unlike the glitz and glamour that would define later Strip properties, the Frontier catered to a middle-class clientele and families. It aimed to evoke a feeling of authenticity - a little dusty, a little rough around the edges, but undeniably Nevada. The hotel initially consisted of just a few buildings and rapidly expanded over the years to accommodate the growing popularity of Las Vegas.

## The “[Lady Luck](/posts/lady-luck-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/)” & Frontier Memorabilia

Speaking of authenticity, the Frontier became synonymous with its iconic neon sign featuring "Lady Luck." This figure, often described as a playful and slightly mischievous muse, symbolized the gambling experience – a blend of hope and chance. Many items related to The Frontier are highly sought after by collectors of vintage Las Vegas memorabilia. One particularly desirable item is a ladies’ V-neck shirt featuring the "Lady Luck" logo. These shirts, often distributed as promotional giveaways, represent a tangible piece of Frontier history – a glimpse into the era of cowboys, showgirls, and the promise of fortune. Finding one in good condition is a true treasure for any Vegas history buff.

## The Ruffin Era and a Brief Revival

The late 1990s saw a brief resurgence for the Frontier when Phil Ruffin acquired the property and rebranded it as the “New Frontier.”  A significant $20 million renovation was undertaken, aimed at modernizing the facilities and attracting a broader customer base. New dining options were introduced, and the hotel received a much-needed facelift. This revitalization temporarily halted the inevitable decline.  Ruffin’s initial plans for a dramatic replacement, "City by the Bay," a San Francisco-themed resort, were ambitious but ultimately hindered by financial challenges. A partnership with Donald Trump led to the construction of Trump [International](/posts/international-hotel-las-vegas/), partially utilizing Frontier land, demonstrating the hotel's continued strategic value.

## An End of an Era & A Spectacular Demolition

Despite the efforts to revive it, the New Frontier's time was limited.  The 2005 sale to El Ad Properties for a staggering $1.2 billion marked a pivotal moment. It was a record-breaking real estate deal that signaled the changing landscape of the Las Vegas Strip.  The hotel closed its doors in July 2007 without the fanfare one might expect from such an iconic establishment. Its implosion in November 2007, preceded by a dazzling fireworks display, was a bittersweet spectacle, drawing large crowds and signifying the end of an era.  Even the beloved roadside sign lingered for an extra year before being removed, a final farewell to a Las Vegas landmark.

## Legacy and What Remains

Today, the land where the New Frontier once stood remains vacant, a stark reminder of the Strip's relentless evolution.  While Wynn Resorts acquired the property and initially planned “Wynn West,” those plans have been paused.  The Frontier’s legacy lives on not just in collectors’ items like that vintage “Lady Luck” ladies’ V-neck shirt, but also in the memories of countless visitors who experienced the unique charm of a bygone era of Las Vegas. It serves as a powerful illustration of how quickly even the most established institutions can disappear in the ever-changing world of the Las Vegas Strip.
