## A Frontier Spirit on the Strip

The Frontier Hotel and Casino, later rebranded as the New Frontier, holds a unique place in Las Vegas Strip history. Opened in 1942 as the Apache Hotel, it quickly became “The Frontier” to capitalize on the post-war Western craze. It stood as a symbol of the burgeoning Las Vegas – a place offering affordable entertainment and a gritty, energetic atmosphere that drew a different crowd than the more upscale resorts beginning to emerge. Unlike the glitz and glamour of the Sands or the Flamingo, the Frontier catered largely to a middle-class clientele, families, and those seeking a more casual gaming experience.

## The Ruffin Years & The Ladies V-Neck

Fast forward to 1998. Phil Ruffin’s acquisition and return to the “New Frontier” name marked a brief but important period. He recognized the need for modernization. A $20 million renovation brought updated dining options and refreshed interiors, temporarily revitalizing the property. It was during this era that a particularly memorable souvenir gained popularity: the Frontier Hotel and Casino Ladies V-Neck shirt. These weren't fancy, high-end items; they were affordable, accessible, and perfectly encapsulated the Frontier’s blue-collar appeal. Seeing a vintage one today is a direct connection to that era – a tangible reminder of those who frequented the casino. 

These shirts became a sought-after piece of Vegas memorabilia, representing more than just a vacation souvenir; they symbolized a connection to a specific time and place in Las Vegas's evolution. They reflected a demographic that found a home at the Frontier that other casinos didn't specifically cater to. Think about it: who *didn’t* want a little piece of the Vegas experience to take home?

## Demolition & Legacy

The New Frontier's time was ultimately limited. Ruffin's ambitious plans for City by the Bay and later a collaboration with Donald Trump (resulting in Trump International) signaled a desire to move beyond the Frontier’s established identity. The final sale to El Ad Properties in 2005, a staggering $1.2 billion, underscored its prime Strip location and potential. The 2007 implosion, accompanied by a fireworks display, felt anticlimactic, a quiet end to a significant chapter. While the roadside sign lingered for a while, its eventual removal cleared the way for Wynn’s expansion. Today, the land remains vacant, a constant reminder of what once stood there. While Wynn West plans have ebbed and flowed, the memory of the Frontier – and that iconic ladies V-neck – lives on in the hearts of vintage Vegas enthusiasts and those who remember its unique charm.
