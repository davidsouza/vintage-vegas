## From Restaurant to Vegas Icon

The corner of Fremont and First Street in Las Vegas holds a special place in the city’s history, and much of that is thanks to the Pioneer Club. Believe it or not, the building itself dates back to 1918, originally serving as a restaurant. But its true rise to fame began in 1942 when it transitioned into a unique establishment - a club and cocktail lounge. This marked the genesis of what would become a beloved Las Vegas institution.

## The Golden Age of Fremont Street

The mid-20th century was the heart of Fremont Street’s dominance as *the* Las Vegas Strip. The Pioneer Club thrived during this era, embodying the playful and somewhat rough-and-tumble spirit of early Vegas. It wasn’t about glitz and glamour (though it had its charm); it was about a lively atmosphere, strong cocktails, and a welcoming, slightly edgy vibe. The iconic Vegas Vic sign, a singing cowboy, became an instant symbol of the Pioneer, greeting visitors with his folksy tunes and contributing to the overall atmosphere. 

## Expansion and Transformation

The 1960s brought a significant shift. In 1965, the Pioneer Club took a bold step, purchasing the adjacent Elwell Hotel. This acquisition allowed them to expand, rebranding the hotel as the Pioneer Club Hotel. Sadly, this chapter proved short-lived.  Just four years later, in 1969, the hotel portion was sold, and the property began a series of name and ownership changes. It briefly existed as the “New Pioneer Club” between 1956 and 1967, bouncing through the hands of owners like Margaret Elardi and Gold Strike Resorts.  The continual shifts were a sign of the changing tides of Las Vegas – the rise of the mega-resorts on the Strip.

## The Demise and a Surprising Revival

By the 1980s, competition from the burgeoning mega-resorts on the Strip became almost insurmountable.  In 1984, the Pioneer Club was sold to the Golden Nugget, who promptly demolished the hotel to construct a parking garage.  The club itself persevered for a few more years, but ultimately succumbed to the pressures of the evolving Las Vegas landscape, closing its doors for good in 1995.

However, the Pioneer Club's story didn't entirely end there. In 1998, Schiff Enterprises acquired the property and breathed new life into the space, repurposing it as a souvenir store. Remarkably, the vintage Pioneer Club signs and the unforgettable Vegas Vic still stand proudly on the building’s exterior, serving as poignant reminders of a bygone era. While the casino is gone, the legacy of the Pioneer Club – a symbol of vintage Las Vegas – lives on.
