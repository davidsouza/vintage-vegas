## From Restaurant to Vegas Landmark: The Pioneer's Early Years

The corner of First and Fremont Street in Las Vegas holds a lot of history, and the building currently housing a souvenir shop is no exception. Long before the mega-resorts and dazzling lights, a simple restaurant stood there, dating back to 1918. But it was in 1942 that it truly began its journey toward becoming a legendary Las Vegas institution – the Pioneer Club. Initially a club and cocktail lounge, it quickly became a popular spot for locals and visitors seeking a taste of the burgeoning Vegas nightlife.

## The [Elwell](/posts/elwell-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Acquisition & A Hotel is Born

What truly set the Pioneer apart was its unique approach. It wasn't just a gambling den; it was a social hub. The club's owners understood the changing landscape and sought expansion. In 1965, a significant move was made: the purchase of The Elwell Hotel. This acquisition allowed the Pioneer Club to become the Pioneer Club Hotel, significantly expanding its footprint and appealing to a wider clientele. For a short time, it operated under the name the New Pioneer Club (1956-1967), further solidifying its place in the city’s development.

## A Short-Lived Hotel, A Lasting Image

Unfortunately, the hotel portion of the Pioneer Club proved unsustainable. In 1969, it was sold, and the Elwell was transformed into what became the Golden Hotel, marking a shift in the Pioneer’s identity. Despite this change, the original club remained a vital part of the Fremont Street Experience, and in 1983, a further expansion saw the acquisition of [Club Bingo](/posts/club-bingo-las-vegas/), significantly increasing its casino floor. The club's owners included notable figures like Margaret Elardi and Gold Strike Resorts, each leaving their mark on the Pioneer's story.

## Demise and Legacy: Vegas Vic and the Pioneer Spirit

The relentless growth of Las Vegas and the rise of larger, more opulent casinos ultimately took their toll. In 1984, the Pioneer Club was sold to the Golden Nugget, who, in a move that saddened many longtime Vegas enthusiasts, demolished the hotel portion to build a parking garage. The club itself finally closed its doors in 1995, unable to compete with the behemoths that now dominated the Strip. 

While the building itself has been repurposed – it now functions as a souvenir store – the legacy of the Pioneer Club lives on. Its vintage neon signs, including the instantly recognizable Vegas Vic, remain proudly displayed, serving as a poignant reminder of a bygone era of Las Vegas. The Pioneer Club embodies the charm and intimacy of old Vegas, a stark contrast to the modern, sprawling resorts. It’s a story of adaptation, survival, and ultimately, a testament to the enduring spirit of vintage Las Vegas.
