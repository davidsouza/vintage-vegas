## A Rapid Fire of Names & Transformations on Tropicana

The Las Vegas Strip’s history isn’t just about the iconic casinos we know today. It’s a landscape of constant evolution, rebranding, and often, forgotten chapters. One such chapter belongs to the property currently known as the OYO Hotel & Casino, formerly The Treasury Hotel & Casino. Its story is a whirlwind of name changes, architectural experiments, and a brief but memorable foray into a decidedly unique theme.

The site’s journey began in 1973 as a standard Howard Johnson’s motel, a familiar roadside stop for travelers. But Las Vegas wasn’t meant to be just a stopping point; it was striving to be *the* destination. In 1975, it transitioned to the Paradise Hotel & Casino, marking its first attempt at casino integration. However, the Paradise moniker proved fleeting.

## The Treasury: A Country & Western Twist

1977 saw another rebranding, this time as the 20th Century Hotel & Casino. Then, in 1978, came the moment that truly set this property apart: it became The Treasury. This was no ordinary casino-hotel. The Treasury embraced a bold, "country and western" theme, a striking contrast to the prevailing glitz and glamour that defined the Las Vegas Strip at the time.  Think showgirl statues (a delightfully odd pairing!), parking lot columns designed to resemble theatrical sets, and a general aesthetic that felt more honky-tonk than high-roller.  Photos from around 1981-1983 showcase the property’s distinctive exterior, a visual anomaly amongst its contemporaries.  It was a gamble – and ultimately, a risky one.

## Short-Lived Prosperity & A Swift Decline

The Treasury's tenure was relatively short. In 1982, it was purchased by former football player Gerry Philbin. Unfortunately, Philbin lacked the necessary Nevada gaming license, forcing the casino operations to abruptly close.  The hotel itself, however, continued to operate for a short while longer, clinging to a fading identity.

## From Polynesian Paradise to Hooters and Beyond

The property’s evolution didn’t stop there.  It later became the Pacifica Resort, reflecting a shift towards a tropical theme. This transitioned into the Polynesian, then the Hôtel San Rémo, before finally morphing into the infamous Hooters Casino Hotel in 2006.  The current OYO Hotel & Casino represents yet another chapter in a long and varied legacy. 

The Treasury Hotel & Casino serves as a fascinating reminder of the experimental nature of Las Vegas. It embodies a time when casinos were willing to take risks, even if those risks didn’t always pan out. While gone, The Treasury's unique "country and western" flair remains a quirky and memorable footnote in the history of the Las Vegas Strip.
