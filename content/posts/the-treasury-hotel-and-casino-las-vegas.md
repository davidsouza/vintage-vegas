## From HoJo's to Country Flair: A History of Constant Change

The Las Vegas Strip has always been about reinvention. But few properties embody this spirit as thoroughly as the current OYO Hotel & Casino, located at 115 East [Tropicana](/posts/tropicana-country-club-las-vegas/) Avenue. Its history reads like a frantic game of branding musical chairs, starting in 1973 as a perfectly ordinary Howard Johnson’s hotel, a familiar roadside stop for weary travelers. For a few years, it filled a practical need, positioned conveniently close to the burgeoning resort corridor. However, the seeds of change were already sown.

The mid-1970s saw ownership shifts, leading to the brief existence of the [Paradise Hotel and Casino](/posts/paradise-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/). Then came the name that, for a time, set this property apart: The [20th Century](/posts/20th-century-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Hotel & Casino. This name only stuck for a short time before the ambitious (and ultimately fleeting) dream of The Treasury materialized in 1978.

## Embracing the Country & Western Theme

The Treasury distinguished itself immediately. While the Strip trended towards opulent Roman themes and Egyptian extravagance, The Treasury dared to be different. Its theme – country and western – was a bold, almost defiant choice.  Imagine showgirl statues, but dressed in fringed jackets and cowboy boots, adorning the signage.  Parking lot columns were transformed into whimsical theatrical props. This wasn’t the Vegas of Frank Sinatra and Rat Pack; it was a playful, slightly kitschy take on Americana. It was *distinctive*, and that’s what drew some patrons in. Period photographs from 1981-1983 vividly capture the visual spectacle of this brief era. The ambition was to create a full-blown, themed experience, a novelty among the increasingly uniform landscape of Las Vegas resorts.

## A Brief Reign & a Rocky Transition

The Treasury's run, unfortunately, wasn’t long. By 1982, the property was sold to former football player Gerry Philbin. However, Philbin lacked the necessary Nevada gaming license, which ultimately led to the closure of the casino operations. The hotel portion continued for a short time, a lonely reminder of the themed excitement that once thrived within. The rapid succession of names and owners reflects a struggle to find a sustainable niche on the intensely competitive Strip. 

Following Philbin’s tenure, the property cycled through a series of identities – the Pacifica Resort, the [Polynesian](/posts/polynesian-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), and Hôtel San Rémo – each attempting a new appeal. These changes demonstrate how quickly Las Vegas tastes shifted, and how challenging it was to stay relevant. The final metamorphosis arrived in 2006 with the arrival of Hooters, a more mainstream and family-friendly concept. Today, as part of the OYO Hotel & Casino, it stands as a testament to the relentless evolution of the Las Vegas Strip, and a quirky, often forgotten, chapter in its fascinating history.
