## A Skyscraper Arrives on the Strip

The Riviera Hotel and Casino, affectionately known as “The Riv,” was a crucial piece of Las Vegas history. Opening its doors on April 20, 1955, it wasn’t just another casino; it was the first skyscraper in the Las Vegas Valley. Nine stories and 291 rooms seemed futuristic for the burgeoning Strip at the time, instantly changing the skyline and setting a new standard for Vegas resorts. The Riviera was a French-themed oasis, bringing a touch of European elegance to the desert. It represented the ambition and rapid growth characterizing the Las Vegas era of the 1950s – a time when the city was actively courting tourists and solidifying its place as the entertainment capital of the world.

## Years of Expansion and Entertainment

The Riviera wasn’t content to remain static. Throughout the decades, expansions added towers - a 12-story in 1966, a 17-story in 1975, and finally a massive 24-story addition in 1988 – ultimately bringing the resort to over 2,000 rooms and a sprawling 103,800-square-foot casino. The hotel hosted a parade of iconic entertainers over the years, adding to its legendary status. 

## Financial Challenges and a Shift in Focus

Like many Vegas institutions, The Riviera faced its share of financial hurdles. Bankruptcy filings in 1983 and again in 1991 tested its resilience. Following the second bankruptcy, the hotel refocused, targeting a broader, middle-class demographic, proving that Vegas wasn't just for the high rollers.

## The End of an Era & A New Beginning

In February 2015, the inevitable arrived. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA) purchased the Riviera for $191 million with the sole purpose of demolition and expansion of the Las Vegas Convention Center. The Riv officially closed its doors on May 4, 2015, marking the end of a beloved era for many. Demolition followed in 2016, erasing a significant landmark from the Las Vegas skyline. 

## Legacy and Future

While the physical Riviera is gone, its legacy lives on in the memories of those who visited and worked there. The land it occupied has now entered a new chapter, passed through several hands and development plans, eventually being sold for $125 million in 2024. Though the future of the property remains to be fully realized, it’s a reminder that even in a city built on reinvention, the ghosts of Vegas's past continue to shape its future.
