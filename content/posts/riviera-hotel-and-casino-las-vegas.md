## The Riviera: A Strip Pioneer

The Riviera Hotel and Casino. Just the name conjures images of old-school Vegas glamour, a far cry from the mega-resorts that dominate the Las Vegas Strip today. Opening its doors on April 20, 1955, The Riv was a groundbreaking presence. Not only was it a sparkling new casino-hotel, but it also marked a significant shift in the city's skyline - it was the first skyscraper in the Las Vegas Valley! Originally boasting nine stories and 291 rooms, the Riviera instantly announced Las Vegas’s ambition to become a world-class destination.

## A Colorful and Turbulent History

The Riviera's history was as vibrant and complex as Vegas itself. Founded by a consortium of investors including Milton Prell and Herbert "Herb" Isenberg, it quickly became a hot spot.  It attracted a sophisticated crowd drawn to its lush tropical décor, elaborate fountains, and a lively casino floor.  The iconic neon sign, a beacon on the north end of the Strip, became synonymous with vintage Las Vegas.  The hotel expanded significantly over the decades, adding towers in 1966, 1975, and a particularly striking 24-story addition in 1988, reflecting the city’s growth. 

The resort wasn't without its financial challenges, however.  Multiple bankruptcies – in 1983 and again in 1991 - tested its resilience. But The Riv always seemed to bounce back, adapting to changing times. A key turning point came in 1985 when it shifted its focus to a middle-class demographic, broadening its appeal and ensuring a steady flow of visitors.

## Entertainment and Lasting Impact

The Riviera's entertainment roster was legendary. It hosted iconic performers like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Elvis Presley, further solidifying its reputation as a premier entertainment destination. Beyond the headliners, the hotel played host to countless comedy acts, showrooms, and special events, always striving to provide a memorable experience. The convention space expansion in the late 1990s kept The Riviera profitable for many years, cementing its role in Las Vegas's vital tourism ecosystem.

## A Demise and a Future

Sadly, the Riviera’s story came to an end in 2015.  The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA) purchased the property for $191 million with the explicit intention of demolition to expand the Las Vegas Convention Center. The hotel closed its doors on May 4, 2015, and was ultimately demolished in 2016.  While its physical presence is gone, The Riviera’s legacy remains firmly embedded in the lore of vintage Las Vegas. The land, initially offered for sale, has been through several ownership changes and is now poised for a new development spearheaded by Brett Torino and Paul Kanavos, with a potential connection to Fontainebleau Las Vegas.  Though a piece of history vanished, the land it occupied will continue to contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of the Las Vegas Strip.
