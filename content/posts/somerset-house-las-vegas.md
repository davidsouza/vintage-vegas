## A Quiet Corner of the Convention Center Drive Boom

The Las Vegas Strip has always conjured images of glittering casinos and dazzling shows, but the story of Las Vegas is so much more than just the marquee lights. It's a story built on the back of countless motels and smaller businesses that quietly supported the city's rapid growth, and the Somerset House Motel is a perfect example. Located at 294 Convention Center Drive, nestled just east of the Strip between the iconic [Stardust](/posts/stardust-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) and the bustling Las Vegas Convention Center, the Somerset House operated from 1963 until its closure and demolition in 2011.

## Bridging the Gap: Luxury on a Budget

The 1960s in Las Vegas were a period of incredible expansion. The Convention Center was driving business travelers to the area, and while the major resorts were flourishing, there was a real need for comfortable, reasonably priced lodging. The Somerset House aimed to fill that niche. Unlike the smaller, more basic mom-and-pop motels that dotted the landscape, the Somerset House offered a level of amenity and service previously unheard of at its price point.

Vintage postcards touting the property emphasized "spacious, luxuriously furnished” rooms, and for good reason. Eighty rooms boasted kitchenettes—a huge draw for families and longer stays—while every room featured direct-dial phones, TV, radio, central air conditioning and heating. These weren’t just perks; they were considered cutting-edge luxury at the time.  On-site amenities included a restaurant, cocktail lounge, coffee shop, an Olympic-size heated swimming pool, and even an electric elevator. Free coffee was the cherry on top, a small detail that speaks volumes about the era’s dedication to guest comfort.

## A Strategic Location and a Supporting Role

The Somerset House's location was key. Being just a short walk from the Strip allowed guests to easily enjoy the excitement and entertainment without paying Strip-level prices. Its proximity to the Convention Center made it a natural choice for attendees – offering a convenient and comfortable home base for business travel. The motel was part of a larger development orchestrated by Irwin Kishner, who created a corridor of motels and commercial centers along Convention Center Drive and Kishner Drive. These businesses were vital to supporting the Strip’s boom, catering to a wider range of visitors than the glitzy resorts alone could reach.

## A Vanishing Legacy

Sadly, like so many of these mid-century motels, the Somerset House couldn't withstand the relentless march of progress. By the 2000s, it had aged, and the economics simply weren't favorable. It closed around 2010 and was demolished in 2011.  Kishner himself lamented its loss, describing the now-vacant lot where it once stood. While it never achieved the fame of the casinos, the Somerset House Motel stands as a poignant reminder of a vital, often overlooked, chapter in Las Vegas history – the era of the comfortable, mid-priced motor inn that quietly powered the city’s growth. It’s a testament to how the landscape of Las Vegas constantly evolves, replacing the familiar with the new, leaving behind echoes of a bygone era.
