## A Quiet Contributor to Vegas's Growth

Las Vegas history isn’t just about the dazzling Strip casinos. It’s about the countless motels, hotels, and businesses that quietly fueled the city's expansion, catering to a diverse clientele. Among these, the Somerset House Motel, located at 294 Convention Center Drive, stands as a poignant reminder of a bygone era. Opened in 1963, this three-story, 104-room motor inn occupied a strategic position just east of the Strip, nestled between the iconic [Stardust](/posts/stardust-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) and the burgeoning Las Vegas Convention Center.

## Bridging the Gap: Comfort and Convenience

The Somerset House wasn’t a sprawling resort, but it offered a level of comfort and amenities that set it apart from the basic roadside motels of the time. Vintage postcards touted “spacious, luxuriously furnished” rooms, and they weren’t exaggerating. Each of the 104 rooms boasted a kitchenette, direct-dial phone (a huge deal back then!), TV, radio, central air conditioning & heating – luxuries many smaller motels couldn’t offer. The inclusion of 80 kitchenettes was particularly significant, catering to families and longer stays. The property also featured on-site amenities like a restaurant, cocktail lounge, and coffee shop, creating a mini-destination in itself.

## A Haven for Conventions and Roadtrippers

Its location was key. The proximity to the Las Vegas Convention Center made the Somerset House a hugely popular choice for convention attendees seeking a more affordable alternative to the Strip's high prices. Families on road trips also appreciated the convenience and comfortable accommodations. It was part of a cluster of motels and businesses developed by Irwin Kishner, forming a vital commercial corridor. The on-site Olympic-size heated swimming pool, electric elevator, and complimentary coffee further enhanced the appeal. It offered a crucial service, acting as a bridge between the smaller motels and the massive resorts.

## A Passing of an Era

Like so many of Las Vegas’s older motels, the Somerset House couldn’t withstand the relentless march of progress. By the 2000s, the property had aged and the economics of operating it became increasingly challenging. It closed its doors around 2010 and was sadly demolished in 2011. Kishner lamented the loss, noting the vacant lot it left behind. 

The Somerset House Motel may not be a household name like the Flamingo or Caesar’s Palace, but it represents a vital, often overlooked, chapter in Las Vegas history—the era of the comfortable, mid-priced motor inn that quietly supported the city’s explosive growth. Its disappearance is a stark reminder of how quickly even cherished landmarks can fade, making way for the next iteration of Las Vegas's ever-evolving story. As of late 2025, the site remains vacant, awaiting its next chapter, but the memory of the Somerset House lives on.
