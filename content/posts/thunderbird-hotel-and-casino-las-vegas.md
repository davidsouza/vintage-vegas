## A Southwest Welcome on the Early Strip

The Las Vegas Strip wasn’t always the sprawling behemoth it is today. Back in 1948, it was a fledgling stretch of highway (Highway 91, now the Strip) with just a handful of resorts vying for the attention of visitors. Among them stood the Thunderbird Hotel and Casino, a vibrant addition to the evolving landscape and a symbol of early Vegas ambition.

Opened on September 2, 1948, the Thunderbird wasn't initially destined to be the Thunderbird. Originally planned as the “Nevada Ambassador,” the name change reflected a shift towards a distinctly Southwestern theme. Developers Marion Hicks (who previously built the El Cortez) and Nevada’s Lieutenant Governor Clifford A. Jones, along with Joe Wells (father of the beloved Dawn Wells), envisioned a resort that would capture the spirit of the region. While the initial budget was set at $1 million, the soaring costs of construction ultimately exceeded $2 million – a significant sum in those days.

## Southwestern Style and Expansion

The Thunderbird made a statement from the start. The resort featured just 79 rooms initially, a casino, and a lively bar, but it distinguished itself with a striking Southwestern/Navajo design. Portraits of American Indians adorned the walls, and iconic neon Thunderbird statues proudly guarded the entrance, becoming a beloved landmark for visitors. The distinct theming provided a visual contrast to the other resorts emerging on the Strip.

Growth was rapid. Less than a year later, plans were announced for a 78-room expansion costing $750,000, and by 1950, the hotel boasted 206 rooms. To handle even more guests, the adjacent Algiers Hotel (with 110 rooms) opened in 1953, operating as a sister property and offering overflow accommodations. Together, the Thunderbird and Algiers created a memorable, albeit now vanished, complex on the Strip.

## A Swift Demise and a New Dawn

The Thunderbird’s reign, however, was relatively short-lived. On January 1, 1977, the hotel abruptly closed its doors. Almost immediately, it was reborn as the Silverbird Hotel Casino under the ownership of Major Riddle. While the name changed, the Thunderbird’s legacy remained etched in the memories of many.

Today, the historic site of the Thunderbird and Algiers Hotels is being transformed once again, as it becomes the home of the massive Fontainebleau Las Vegas. While the original buildings are gone, their story serves as a poignant reminder of the early days of the Las Vegas Strip and the enduring appeal of vintage Las Vegas charm. The Thunderbird was more than just a hotel; it was a piece of Las Vegas history.
