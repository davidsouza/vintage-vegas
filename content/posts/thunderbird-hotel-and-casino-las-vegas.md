## A Southwestern Oasis on the Strip

The Las Vegas Strip wasn't always the glittering behemoth it is today. Back in 1948, it was a burgeoning stretch of Highway 91, and the Thunderbird Hotel and Casino was a vital piece of that early, pioneering landscape. Opened on September 2nd, 1948, it stood as the fourth resort on the burgeoning Strip, a significant milestone in Las Vegas's evolution from a desert outpost to a gambling and entertainment hub.  It wasn't initially called the Thunderbird, however! The project, announced in March 1946, started life as the “Nevada Ambassador.”

The vision of building developer Marion Hicks – who had already made a splash with the El Cortez – and Nevada’s Lieutenant Governor, Clifford A. Jones, the Thunderbird promised something unique.  Joe Wells, the father of beloved actress Dawn Wells, also had a stake in the venture. The initial budget was a respectable $1 million, but, as often happens in Las Vegas, costs ballooned to over $2 million.

## Thunderbird Style: Navajo Themes and Neon

The Thunderbird wasn’t just about gambling; it was about creating an experience. Hicks and Jones wanted to evoke the spirit of the Southwest. The hotel's decor embraced a Southwestern/Navajo theme, prominently displaying portraits of American Indians and cultivating an atmosphere distinct from the more generic hotel designs of the time. The iconic neon Thunderbird statues that graced the entrance became an instant landmark, visible for miles and a powerful symbol of the developing Strip.  

Initially boasting just 79 rooms, the Thunderbird quickly recognized the appetite for more.  A 78-room expansion was announced in February 1949, followed by further growth, bringing the total room count to 206 by 1950. To further accommodate guests, the adjacent 110-room Algiers Hotel, a sister property with its own distinct Moroccan-inspired theme, was built in 1953.  This pairing created a popular destination for visitors seeking variety.



## A Swift Demise, A Lasting Legacy

Despite its popularity and contributions to the Strip's early development, the Thunderbird Hotel and Casino's run was relatively short. It closed its doors on January 1st, 1977, swiftly transforming into the Silverbird Hotel Casino under the ownership of Major Riddle. The Silverbird’s tenure was even shorter, however, and the property eventually fell into disuse. 

Today, the land once occupied by the Thunderbird and the Algiers – a piece of vintage Las Vegas history – is being reborn as the Fontainebleau Las Vegas. While the Thunderbird’s physical presence is gone, its legacy endures as a key player in the early days of the Las Vegas Strip, a reminder of a time when ambition, neon, and the allure of the Southwest shaped the desert landscape. It serves as a vital piece in the puzzle of how Las Vegas became the entertainment capital of the world.
