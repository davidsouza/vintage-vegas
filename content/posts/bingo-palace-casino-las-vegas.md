## From The Casino to the Bingo Palace: Humble Beginnings on [Sahara](/posts/sahara-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/)

Before the mega-resorts and dazzling spectacle of modern Las Vegas, there were smaller, more intimate gambling halls catering to a different clientele. One such establishment, quietly but significantly, shaped the future of Las Vegas gaming: The Bingo Palace Casino. Its story began modestly in July 1976 as simply “The Casino,” a 5,000-square-foot operation nestled beside the Mini-Price Motor Inn on Sahara Avenue, just off the famed Las Vegas Strip. This wasn’t a place for high rollers; it was a casual, relaxed spot frequented by casino employees looking to unwind after a long shift. Think 100 slot machines, a few table games, a snack bar, and a welcoming atmosphere.

## The Bingo Boom & A Name Change

The real turning point arrived in 1977. Recognizing the burgeoning popularity of bingo, owner Frank Fertitta Jr. brilliantly capitalized on the trend. He rebranded the casino as the Bingo Palace Casino, a name that perfectly captured its newfound focus. This wasn’t just a cosmetic change; it signified a strategic pivot.  The Bingo Palace targeted local residents, offering irresistible specials – cheap buffets, free giveaways – that quickly made it a neighborhood favorite.  This focus on value and community proved incredibly successful.

## Pioneering the “Locals First” Model

The Bingo Palace wasn't just a successful casino; it was a pioneer. It laid the groundwork for what would eventually become the Station Casinos empire. Fertitta Jr. understood something vital: there was a market for approachable, service-oriented gaming experiences that didn’t require a mega-budget.  By prioritizing value and catering to the surrounding neighborhoods, the Bingo Palace crafted a blueprint for a new type of Las Vegas resort – one that valued community and loyalty over extravagant displays. This approach was revolutionary at the time, demonstrating that focusing on the local market could be incredibly profitable and build lasting customer relationships. 

## From Bingo Palace to Palace Station: A New Era Dawns

The success of the Bingo Palace was undeniable. By 1983, the casino had built a fiercely loyal local following and significantly expanded its footprint. Recognizing the opportunity for further growth, Fertitta held a contest to rename the property. The winning entry, Palace Station, proved fitting, ushering in a new era marked by a distinctive railway-themed identity, complete with iconic neon signage. The 1984 revamp included the addition of a hotel tower, solidifying Palace Station’s position as a major player. While the name “Bingo Palace Casino” had a relatively short lifespan, its legacy lives on as the foundational seed of the expansive Station Casinos network, forever changing the landscape of Las Vegas gaming.
