## A Quick Rise and Fall on the Strip

The Silver City Hotel & Casino, though brief in its existence, holds a peculiar place in the history of the Las Vegas Strip. Located at the northeast corner of Sahara Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard (currently the site of Silver City Plaza), the property experienced a series of ownership changes, ambitious plans, and ultimately, a rather unceremonious end. It stands as a reminder of the constant evolution and sometimes fleeting nature of Las Vegas businesses.

Originally, the site housed the Riata Casino, which opened in 1973.  Riata, with its Western theme, proved to be a short-lived venture and closed after just a year. Enter Major Riddle, a casino owner with an eye for opportunity. In 1974, he transformed the site into the Silver City Casino, hoping to capture a different demographic. While never a Strip heavyweight, Silver City carved out a niche for itself during the mid-70s and 80s.

## Circus Circus & a Smoke-Free Vision

The 1981 acquisition by Circus Circus Enterprises, for a hefty $30 million, marked a significant chapter.  This brought fresh investment and renovation, updating the property's look and feel.  What truly set Silver City apart, however, came in 1991. It became the *first* non-smoking casino on the Las Vegas Strip, a bold move in an era when casinos were synonymous with cigarette smoke. This progressive policy, though likely a marketing tactic, positioned Silver City as somewhat of a forward-thinking establishment.

## Luke Brugnara’s Dream & Regulatory Roadblocks

The late 90s brought another shift.  In 1999, Luke Brugnara, a well-known figure in Las Vegas circles, purchased Silver City for $31.5 million. His vision was grand: to transform the property into a San Francisco-themed resort, complete with a hotel and casino.  Mandalay Resort Group was initially contracted to operate the casino, employing around 150 people.  However, Brugnara’s gaming license was under investigation, and just weeks after the purchase, on October 31, 1999, the casino abruptly closed.

Despite multiple attempts and legal considerations, Brugnara's application for a gaming license was ultimately denied in March 2001. While initially contemplating a lawsuit against the Nevada Gaming Control Board, he instead focused on reapplication. This delay effectively halted his ambitious San Francisco dream.

## From Casino to Clothing Store & Beyond

By May 2002, Brugnara sold the property to Angelo, Gordon & Co. Their plans were far less glamorous: demolition to make way for a Ross clothing store. True to their word, the original casino structure was demolished in 2004, and Silver City Plaza, a retail shopping center, rose in its place.  A final, fleeting attempt at resurrecting a new “Tycoon” resort was proposed in 2003, but it never materialized.

The Silver City Hotel & Casino may be gone, but its story serves as a compelling snapshot of Las Vegas history - a tale of ambition, innovation (the smoke-free policy!), and the constant flux that defines the Strip. It’s a testament to how quickly fortunes and businesses can change in this ever-evolving entertainment mecca.
