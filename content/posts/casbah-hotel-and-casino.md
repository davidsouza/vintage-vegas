## A Desert Oasis Born in the 60s

The Casbah Hotel and Casino, a distinctive landmark on the Las Vegas Strip for nearly five decades, is largely forgotten today, a victim of progress and a shifting cityscape. Built in 1963 by the enigmatic Danny Jackson, the Casbah was initially intended to evoke a Moroccan fantasy, a slightly more exotic offering than the emerging string of mid-century modern casinos. Jackson, a figure shrouded in some mystery and rumored to have connections to organized crime, envisioned a sophisticated, albeit slightly seedy, entertainment destination. The original decor – vibrant reds, golds, and intricate mosaics – aimed to transport guests to a faraway land. While it wasn't the glitz of the Sands or the opulence of the Flamingo, the Casbah carved out a niche as a place for a different kind of Vegas experience.

## Family Business and a Shadowy Reputation

Following Jackson’s death, his family continued to operate the Casbah. However, the hotel’s reputation gradually soured. It became known for its association with various unsavory activities – prostitution, gambling debts, and occasional violence. This negativity clung to the property like the desert heat, impacting its success despite attempts at revitalization. The Casbah's isolated location, a bit further north on the Strip, didn't help, leaving it feeling somewhat disconnected from the rapidly evolving heart of the action. 

## Ann Meyer’s Queen of Hearts: A Woman Takes the Reigns

In 1976, a turning point arrived. Ann Meyers, a shrewd businesswoman, purchased the Casbah, becoming the first woman to own a hotel and casino in Las Vegas. Remarkably, Meyers seemed unaware of the full extent of the hotel's tarnished image. Undeterred, she saw potential. She rebranded the property in 1990 as Ann Meyer’s Queen of Hearts Hotel, initiating a significant overhaul focused on improving service and creating a more welcoming atmosphere. Initial results were positive; business picked up, and the Queen of Hearts enjoyed a brief period of increased popularity.

## The Lingering Past and Inevitable Demolition

Despite Meyers’ efforts, the Casbah's past couldn't be entirely erased. The underlying issues—the lingering reputation and continued problems with illicit activities—remained persistent challenges. While she brought a renewed sense of professionalism and a cleaner image, she couldn't completely sanitize the property's history.  

Sadly, the Casbah’s story concluded in 2010. Facing mounting financial pressures and recognizing the strategic value of the land, it was announced that the Queen of Hearts, formerly the Casbah, would be demolished. The site now serves as the location for a new Las Vegas City Hall building and business complex. While its physical presence is gone, the Casbah, and later the Queen of Hearts, remains a fascinating chapter in the vintage Las Vegas narrative – a tale of ambition, redemption attempts, and the enduring impact of a hotel’s complicated history on the Strip.
