## A Taste of Morocco on the Strip: The [Casbah](/posts/casbah-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/)’s Early Years

The Las Vegas Strip has seen countless hotels rise and fall, each leaving its mark on the city’s unique character. One such hotel, the Casbah, stands out for its distinct Moroccan theme and, perhaps more notably, its complicated history. Built in 1963 by the ambitious Danny Jackson, the Casbah aimed to offer a different kind of Vegas experience – a touch of exoticism amidst the burgeoning glitz and neon. Jackson, already a prominent figure in Las Vegas gambling circles, envisioned a casino that transported guests to a North African oasis. The décor was meticulously planned, featuring vibrant colors, intricate tilework, and lush landscaping, all meant to evoke the atmosphere of Morocco.

## Family Business and a Growing Reputation

Following Jackson’s untimely death, his family continued to operate the Casbah. However, the hotel began to develop a less-than-desirable reputation. Rumors of shady dealings and a permissive attitude towards illegal activities swirled, and the Casbah became known as a place where certain compromises were made. This era solidified the hotel's position within a specific, and somewhat disreputable, corner of Las Vegas’s nightlife.

## Ann Meyers & A Queen's Transformation

In 1976, a pivotal moment arrived: Ann Meyers, a sports icon and businesswoman, purchased the Casbah. This was groundbreaking – Meyers became the first woman to own a hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. Unaware of the full extent of the hotel's problems, she embarked on a mission to revitalize the property. In 1990, she boldly rebranded it as Ann Meyer’s Queen of Hearts Hotel, a clear attempt to distance it from its past. Meyers invested heavily in improving the hotel’s service and atmosphere, hoping to attract a wider clientele. Initially, her efforts bore fruit; business improved, and the Queen of Hearts seemed poised for a successful future.

## Lingering Shadows & A Demise

Despite Meyers' efforts, the legacy of the Casbah proved difficult to shake. Issues like prostitution and violence persisted, creating ongoing challenges. While the Queen of Hearts attracted a more mainstream crowd, the underlying reputation lingered. Ultimately, the writing was on the wall. In 2010, the devastating announcement came: the hotel would be demolished to make way for a new Las Vegas City Hall and business complex. The Queen of Hearts, once a symbol of a woman's ambition in a male-dominated industry, was gone.

The Casbah/Queen of Hearts no longer exists, but its story remains a fascinating chapter in vintage Las Vegas history, a reminder of the Strip’s evolution, its complexities, and the often-turbulent journey of those who dared to build their dreams in the desert.
