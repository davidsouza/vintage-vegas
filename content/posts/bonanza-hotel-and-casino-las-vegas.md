## A Western Dream Briefly Blooms on the Strip

Before the dazzling mega-resorts, before the choreographed fountains, and even before some of the iconic properties we know today, the Las Vegas Strip was still evolving. A fascinating piece of that evolution was the Bonanza Hotel and Casino, which opened its doors on July 1, 1967, at 3645 South Las Vegas Boulevard. Nestled between the Three Coins and the Galaxy Motel – using them as overflow lodging, showcasing early Strip resourcefulness – the Bonanza attempted to capture the Wild West spirit with a distinct themed design.

It was a relatively small operation compared to the titans emerging on the Strip. Boasting only 160 rooms, it paled in comparison to the burgeoning luxury resorts, but it aimed to carve out its own niche. The casino, however, ran into financial trouble remarkably quickly, closing just three months after opening. While the casino shuttered, the hotel continued operating, a testament to the initial investment’s desire to keep some portion of the property alive.

## Kirk Kerkorian's Brief Involvement & A Country Music Debut

The Bonanza's fortunes took a turn when the legendary Kirk Kerkorian, a man who shaped the very face of the Las Vegas Strip, purchased the property at the end of 1968. He quickly flipped it to a group of investors a few months later. This new ownership brought a resurgence; the Bonanza reopened in May 1969, revitalized but still fraught with internal conflict.

A significant power struggle between two top investors over management led to a legal battle, eventually settled, highlighting the volatile nature of Vegas business ventures. Despite the behind-the-scenes drama, the Bonanza carved out a niche, becoming a hotspot for country music fans. It's particularly remembered as the venue for Buck Owens’ very first performance on the Las Vegas Strip in 1969 – a major coup for the property and a significant moment in Vegas entertainment history. The Bonanza also offered a unique entertainment blend with a showroom and a theater showcasing classic films.

## A Short Life, A Lasting Legacy

Sadly, the Bonanza’s time was short-lived. Kerkorian, ever the shrewd businessman, filed a foreclosure action in 1970, reclaiming control. The property ultimately closed its doors for good in early 1973. While the Bonanza Hotel and Casino itself is gone, its location now houses the [Horseshoe](/posts/horseshoe-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Las Vegas, a far cry from its original Wild West aesthetic. Yet, for those who remember, the Bonanza stands as a poignant reminder of a different era on the Las Vegas Strip – a time when smaller, themed resorts dreamed of capturing a piece of the Vegas magic, even if only for a little while.
