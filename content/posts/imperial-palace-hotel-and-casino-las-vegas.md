## From [Flamingo Capri](/posts/flamingo-capri-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) to Imperial Grandeur

The Las Vegas Strip has seen countless transformations over the decades, and few properties have undergone a more dramatic evolution than the former Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino. Its story begins, not as the opulent Chinese-themed resort we remember, but as the Flamingo Capri motel. This modest establishment, built in 1960, eventually caught the eye of Ralph Engelstad, a North Dakota entrepreneur known for his ambitious projects and, unfortunately, controversial personal collections. Engelstad’s purchase in the early 1970s marked the beginning of a massive shift for the property. He initially added a casino in 1972, laying the groundwork for what was to come.

## A Pagoda Roof and a Palace of Dreams

November 1, 1979, brought the unveiling of the brand new Imperial Palace. Engelstad envisioned a lavish experience evoking the majesty of an ancient Chinese palace, and he spared no expense. The design, spearheaded by architect Merlin J. Barth, was instantly recognizable – a striking blue-tiled pagoda roof imported from Japan, elaborate dragon carvings, and shimmering wind-chime chandeliers. These elements immediately distinguished the Imperial Palace from its contemporaries on the Strip. The initial motel was seamlessly integrated into the expanding complex, and rooms were added to accommodate the burgeoning crowds.

## The Auto Collections and "Legends in Concert"

The 1980s witnessed the Imperial Palace’s tremendous growth. A highlight of this era was the creation of the Auto Collections showroom in 1981. Housing a staggering collection of 250 classic, antique, and muscle cars—valued at over $100 million—it became a major draw for both car enthusiasts and casual visitors. Equally iconic was the launch of "Legends in Concert" in May 1983. This tribute show, featuring incredibly talented impersonators of music legends like Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and Cher, captivated audiences and ultimately became the longest-running show in Las Vegas history, solidifying the Imperial Palace’s reputation as a premier entertainment destination. The property also cultivated a lively atmosphere with seasonal luaus and [Polynesian](/posts/polynesian-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/)-themed pool parties.

## A Shadow and a Legacy

While the Imperial Palace offered a family-friendly and relatively affordable experience, its legacy was unfortunately complicated by Engelstad's private collections, including controversial Nazi memorabilia. This aspect cast a long shadow over the property and its reputation. Following Engelstad’s passing in 2002, the property was acquired by Caesars Entertainment (then Harrah’s) in 2005. Recognizing the need for a modernization and alignment with the evolving landscape of the Las Vegas Strip, the Imperial Palace underwent a significant rebranding. 

The property’s transformation continued with its renaming as The Quad Resort & Casino in 2012 and subsequently The LINQ in 2014, firmly integrating it into the vibrant LINQ Promenade and showcasing the iconic High Roller Observation Wheel. While the Imperial Palace as we knew it is gone, its unique theme, its legendary shows, and its incredible car collection remain etched in the memory of vintage Las Vegas enthusiasts.
