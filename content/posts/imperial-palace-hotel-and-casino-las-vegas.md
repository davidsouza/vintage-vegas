## From Flamingo Capri to Imperial Grandeur

The Las Vegas Strip has seen countless transformations, but few were as distinct as the rise and fall of the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino. Originally the Flamingo Capri, a humble motel, the property at 3535 Las Vegas Boulevard underwent a dramatic rebirth in the early 1970s thanks to entrepreneur Ralph Engelstad. While he initially added a small casino in 1972, the real magic happened on November 1, 1979, when the Imperial Palace officially debuted.

Engelstad envisioned a lavish homage to ancient Chinese palaces, and the design, spearheaded by architect Merlin J. Barth, was nothing short of spectacular. A striking blue-tiled pagoda roof, imported directly from Japan, dominated the skyline. Intricate dragon carvings adorned the interiors, complemented by the gentle chimes of custom-made chandeliers. It was a truly immersive experience, setting it apart from the increasingly modern designs sprouting up on the Strip.

## Cars, Shows, and Treasures

The Imperial Palace wasn’t just about its aesthetics. Engelstad was a car enthusiast, and in 1981, he unveiled the Auto Collections, a stunning showroom housing 250 classic, antique, and muscle cars valued at over $100 million. This unique attraction became a major draw for visitors. Entertainment was also key, with the legendary “Legends in Concert” show launched in 1983, becoming the longest-running show in Las Vegas history – a testament to its enduring popularity. The property consistently offered seasonal celebrations, including vibrant Polynesian-themed pool parties.

Throughout the 1980s, the Imperial Palace expanded rapidly, adding four hotel towers, a sprawling shopping arcade dubbed the “Court of a Thousand Treasures,” an Olympic-size pool with a waterfall, and a variety of other amenities. It carved out a niche as a family-friendly resort offering good value, drawing in a wide range of visitors.

## A Shadowed Legacy & Transformation

Despite its success and popularity, the Imperial Palace's legacy was complicated. Engelstad's personal collections, which controversially included Nazi memorabilia, became a source of criticism and discomfort, overshadowing some of the property's positive attributes. Following Engelstad's death in 2002, Caesars Entertainment (then Harrah’s) acquired the Imperial Palace in 2005.

Recognizing the need for modernization, the resort underwent significant renovations and rebranding. It was reimagined as The Quad in 2012, then again as The LINQ in 2014, now a central component of the vibrant LINQ Promenade and home to the High Roller observation wheel. While the Imperial Palace name is gone, its unique architectural style and its role in shaping the history of the Las Vegas Strip remain unforgettable. The memories of its grandeur, its car collection, and its iconic shows continue to resonate with those who experienced it in its prime.
