## A Rising Tide of Entertainment: Introducing Splash

The 1980s Las Vegas Strip was a dazzling place, fueled by ambition, neon, and a relentless pursuit of bigger and better entertainment. While glitz and gambling were ever-present, the era also delivered some truly iconic revue shows, and few shone brighter than "Splash." Debuting in June 1985 at the Riviera Hotel and Casino, *Splash* wasn’t just another Vegas show; it was an “aquacade” – a revolutionary blend of music, dance, and aquatic performance. Created by the visionary Jeff Kutash, it captured the essence of the decade’s vibrant pop culture and rapidly became a cornerstone of the Riviera’s entertainment offerings.

## The Versailles Theatre & the Central Spectacle

Located in the Riviera’s elegant Versailles Theatre, *Splash* immediately distinguished itself. The show's namesake, an 18-foot-tall water tank, served as a focal point, enabling breathtaking aquatic choreography unlike anything seen before. Imagine synchronized swimmers, dancers, and performers seamlessly integrating with laser light shows and dynamic projections – all against the backdrop of the Riviera’s classic, if slightly faded, showroom ambiance. It was a unique combination of old-school Vegas glamour and cutting-edge 80s technology. While other revue shows emphasized elaborate costumes and traditional dance numbers, *Splash* added a layer of theatricality and visual surprise that kept audiences coming back for more.

## Evolving with the Times: From Pop Icons to Ice

*Splash* was far from stagnant. Over its impressive 22-year run, the show consistently evolved, reflecting shifts in pop culture and technological advancements. The 1995 revamp was particularly significant, updating the choreography, costumes, and musical numbers to reflect the tastes of the mid-90s. Later iterations even replaced the original water tank with innovative performance surfaces, most notably incorporating ice skating segments – a bold and unexpected move that kept the show feeling fresh and exciting.  Tribute sections to pop icons were a recurring feature, ensuring relevance across generations of viewers. This ability to adapt while retaining its core appeal was key to its longevity.

## A Legacy of Vegas Innovation

*Splash* closed its doors in September 2006, just weeks before the Riviera itself met its end. The show's two-decade run is remarkable, especially considering the notoriously fickle nature of Las Vegas entertainment. It was a reflection of a Las Vegas at a crossroads—honoring the legacy of classic showroom revues while embracing the burgeoning world of multimedia spectacle.  It demonstrated that while Vegas craved novelty, it also appreciated the timeless appeal of high-quality entertainment.  While the Riviera and *Splash* are now memories, their impact on Las Vegas entertainment history remains undeniable, a testament to the enduring magic of vintage Vegas.
