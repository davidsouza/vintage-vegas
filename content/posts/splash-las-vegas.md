# A Cascade of Memories: Remembering Splash Las Vegas

The Las Vegas Strip has always been a place of spectacle, but few productions managed to capture the era quite like *Splash* at the Riviera Hotel and Casino. Running for an astonishing 22 years (1985-2006), *Splash* wasn't just a show; it was a vibrant, evolving reflection of Las Vegas' entertainment history.

## The Riviera and the Birth of an Aquacade

The Riviera, a legendary landmark on the Strip, was already known for its classic Vegas charm. In June 1985, it upped the ante with *Splash*, conceived and produced by Jeff Kutash. Billed as an “aquacade,” the show deliberately distinguished itself from the traditional showgirl revues that dominated the landscape. The centerpiece? A massive 18-foot-tall water tank, integral to the choreography and theatrical experience. This was truly something different.

## Riding the 80s Wave

*Splash* expertly embodied the 1980s aesthetic. Think vibrant pop culture references, dynamic dancing, dazzling costumes, and cutting-edge (for the time) laser and programmed lighting effects. The musical numbers were a blend of contemporary hits and classic showtunes, keeping the show consistently fresh and appealing to a broad audience. The show cleverly balanced traditional Vegas glamour with the playful, energetic vibe of the decade. 

## Evolution and Adaptation

What truly cemented *Splash’s* place in Las Vegas history was its ability to evolve. The show wasn't static. In 1995, a significant revamp modernized the production, incorporating more contemporary influences and stage effects. Later iterations even replaced the original water tank with innovative performance surfaces like an ice skating rink, demonstrating a commitment to keeping the show engaging for both returning fans and new audiences. This willingness to adapt ensured its longevity.

## A Legacy of Aquatic Brilliance

*Splash* ultimately closed in September 2006, shortly before the Riviera itself met its end. While the physical manifestations of the show and the hotel are gone, the memories remain. *Splash* represents a fascinating point in Las Vegas history – a bridge between the classic Strip showgirl tradition and the immersive, technologically advanced spectacles that would come to define the later decades. It was a uniquely Vegas experience, a splash (pun intended!) of color, music, and movement that continues to be fondly remembered by those who witnessed its magic.
