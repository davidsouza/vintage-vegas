## From Saloon to License #1: The Early Days

Before the dazzling lights of the Strip, before mega-resorts and celebrity chefs, there was Fremont Street and a whole lot of hope. And at 15 East Fremont Street stood a pivotal piece of Las Vegas history: the Northern Club. Its roots stretch back even further than most realize, to April 1, 1912, when it opened as “The Northern,” a modest saloon and hotel catering to the burgeoning community drawn to the promise of railroad work and later, the massive Hoover Dam project. While gambling and liquor flowed before 1931, it was a semi-clandestine affair, taking advantage of the gray areas in Nevada’s regulations.

## The Dawn of Legalized Gambling and Mayme Stocker’s Place in History

Everything changed on March 20, 1931. Nevada legalized gambling, and in a groundbreaking moment, Mayme Stocker and Joe H. Morgan were awarded Nevada’s *first* legal gaming license for Clark County – license #1 – for the Northern Club. This moment is incredibly significant. Mayme Stocker’s name deserves particular recognition: she’s widely considered to be one of the first, if not *the* first, woman to hold a gaming license in Las Vegas, a remarkable feat for the time, and a powerful symbol of female entrepreneurship in a traditionally male-dominated field. The Stocker family’s role in establishing legal gaming in Las Vegas can't be overstated.

## The Northern Club Era: A Downtown Gamble-Town

The Northern Club wasn’t a sprawling palace like those that would later define the Las Vegas Strip. It was a smaller-scale operation, reflecting the character of downtown Las Vegas in its early years. It was a place for high-stakes games, lively bars, and a vibrant social hub where the rail-town community mingled with those drawn to the promise of opportunity and entertainment. It represented the very essence of the gamble-town spirit that would shape Las Vegas's identity.

## Transformations and Legacy

The Northern Club’s story doesn't end with the Stocker family. Over the years, it underwent several transformations, changing names and ownership. It became the Turf Club in 1943, then the [Monte Carlo Club](/posts/monte-carlo-club-las-vegas/), and later the [Coin Castle](/posts/coin-castle-casino-las-vegas/).  Each iteration added another layer to its unique history.  Ultimately, the property was absorbed into larger downtown casino developments, eventually contributing to the construction of the Fremont Street Experience. 

Though the Northern Club’s name has vanished, its legacy remains etched into the fabric of Las Vegas history. It represents more than just a building; it's a tangible link to the city’s humble beginnings, a testament to the courage of early pioneers like Mayme Stocker, and a reminder of the foundational role that Fremont Street played in building the gaming and entertainment mecca we know today. It's a valuable piece of Nevada's – and Las Vegas’s – story, one that continues to fascinate historians and vintage Las Vegas enthusiasts alike.
