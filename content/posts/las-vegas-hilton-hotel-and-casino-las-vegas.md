## A Hilton Colossus Rises

The Las Vegas Hilton. Just the name evokes a certain era – a time of glitz, grandeur, and serious ambition on the Las Vegas Strip. But the story behind it isn’t as simple as a triumphant opening. It began life as the International Hotel and Casino, a bold project conceived by Kirk Kerkorian to challenge the dominance of the iconic Sahara Hotel.  In 1970 and 1971, Kerkorian sold his shares to Hilton Hotels, and the name changed to Las Vegas Hilton in July 1971. It was a game-changer; it briefly held the title of the world’s tallest building. This signaled a new level of scale for Vegas, showcasing the industry’s willingness to build bigger, bolder, and with more luxury.

## Growth & Entertainment

Under Hilton’s management, the property flourished.  The initial years weren't without their hiccups, but Hilton's expertise proved transformative.  Expansions became routine, each adding to the hotel's immense size and allure. The 1975 east tower was a significant addition, followed by the Hilton Pavilion in 1977 – a prime venue for concerts, boxing matches, and other spectacular events.  Those boxing matches? They were legendary, showcasing some of the biggest names in the sport and becoming a defining characteristic of the Las Vegas Hilton. And that north tower extension in 1981, adding 644 more rooms, truly solidified its position as the undisputed champion in terms of size.

## Tragedy and Resilience

The sheer scale of the Las Vegas Hilton made the February 10, 1981, fire all the more devastating. The quick-moving blaze, intentionally set by busboy Philip Cline, resulted in eight deaths and 350 injuries. The immediate aftermath was heartbreaking, and the rebuilding was remarkable. The hotel reopened just nine days later, albeit with partial capacity – a testament to the resilience of the Las Vegas spirit. Cline’s conviction and life sentence served as a stark reminder of the dark side that could lurk even amidst the bright lights. The tragedy also spurred critical changes in Nevada’s fire safety regulations.

## A Reign Ends, A New Chapter Begins

Throughout the 1980s, the Las Vegas Hilton continued to be a major player, adding the Hilton Center and the Superbook, reflecting Vegas' growing embrace of sports betting. However, corporate shifts in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to attempted sales and protracted legal battles. Ultimately, in 2004, Colony Capital acquired the property, marking the end of Hilton’s direct ownership. While the name "Las Vegas Hilton" remained, the financial pressures of the Great Recession eventually led to foreclosure and the termination of the Hilton franchise agreement in 2011. The property, once a symbol of Vegas excess, closed its doors as the Las Vegas Hilton in 2012.

## Legacy as Westgate

Today, the iconic building stands as Westgate Las Vegas. Though the name is different, the legacy of the Las Vegas Hilton remains. It represents a pivotal era in Vegas history – a time of unprecedented growth, architectural ambition, tragedy, and resilience. Its history is woven into the fabric of the Strip, a reminder of the constant evolution and reinvention that defines this desert entertainment mecca.
