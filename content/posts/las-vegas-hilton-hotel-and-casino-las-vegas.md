## The Rise of a Vegas Giant

The Las Vegas Hilton. Just the name conjures up images of glitz, Elvis, and a bygone era of Las Vegas excess. But its story is far more complex than just shimmering lights and showstopping performances. Initially known as the International Hotel and Casino, it was the brainchild of Kirk Kerkorian, aiming to compete with the iconic Sahara and Flamingo. In 1970, Kerkorian began selling shares to Hilton Hotels, a pivotal moment that cemented the property's destiny. The official renaming to Las Vegas Hilton in July 1971 signaled a new chapter and, ultimately, a dramatic shift in its fortunes.

## A Hilton Transformation and Record-Breaking Growth

Under Hilton's management, the hotel experienced a remarkable turnaround. While initially performing inconsistently, the Hilton brand’s operational expertise unlocked the property’s potential. The 1970s saw a flurry of expansion – a 620-room east tower in 1975, followed by the Hilton Pavilion in 1977, providing a dedicated space for sports and entertainment, and yet another north tower expansion adding 644 rooms. These additions catapulted the Las Vegas Hilton to the top, becoming the most successful hotel in Las Vegas. It even briefly held the title of the world’s largest hotel after a major expansion in late 1981, boasting an astounding 3,174 rooms. 

## Tragedy and Resilience: The 1981 Fire

The hotel's history isn’t without its dark moments. The devastating fire on February 10, 1981, was a tragedy that shook the city. Arsonist Philip Bruce Cline, a busboy, deliberately set the blaze, resulting in eight deaths and 350 injuries. While the immediate aftermath was grim, the remarkable speed with which the Las Vegas Hilton reopened – just nine days later – demonstrated the community’s resilience and the hotel's unwavering spirit. The incident prompted significant changes to Nevada's fire safety regulations, forever impacting building codes across the state.

## A Legacy of Entertainment and Betting

The Las Vegas Hilton wasn’t just about rooms; it was a hub of entertainment and a pioneer in the burgeoning sports betting scene. It hosted countless legendary performers, most famously Elvis Presley, who became synonymous with the hotel. The 1986 opening of the Superbook cemented its reputation as a premier destination for sports wagering, reflecting the growing importance of Nevada's unique legal status. 

## From Corporate Shifts to a New Identity

Over the years, corporate ownership changed hands several times. Hilton spun off its casino properties, leading to a turbulent period marked by attempted sales and legal battles. Ultimately, Colony Capital acquired the property in 2004, but financial difficulties during the Great Recession led to the termination of the Hilton franchise agreement and, finally, foreclosure in 2011. The Las Vegas Hilton officially closed its doors in 2012 and was reborn as the Westgate Las Vegas, a tangible reminder of a legendary era on the Las Vegas Strip.
