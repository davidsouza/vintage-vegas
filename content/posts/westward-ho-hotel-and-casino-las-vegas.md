## A [Frontier](/posts/frontier-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Salute on the Strip

For those who remember the Las Vegas Strip of the 1960s and 70s, the Westward Ho Hotel and Casino – affectionately nicknamed “The Ho” – held a special place. Opened in 1963, nestled between the iconic [Stardust](/posts/stardust-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) and where Slots-A-Fun would later rise, it wasn’t just another casino; it was a respectful nod to the westward expansion that defined Nevada’s history. Brothers and sisters Dean Petersen and his siblings were behind the venture, choosing a name that evoked images of covered wagons and the pioneering spirit. 

## More Than Just a Casino: A Resort Experience

Unlike the soaring high-rises that dominate the Strip today, the Westward Ho embraced a more relaxed, motel-style vibe. Sprawling across 15 acres, the property featured low-rise buildings surrounding a main casino building, complete with pools – a welcome oasis in the desert heat. By 1969, the operation had expanded to over 1,000 rooms, catering to families and those seeking a less frantic Vegas experience. A constant, reliable presence was the 24-hour Denny's, a late-night staple for many. The addition of a slot arcade further broadened its appeal. “The Ho” managed to maintain a certain down-to-earth appeal while still offering the core Vegas attractions.

## Family Ownership and a Changing Landscape

The Petersen family’s dedication to the Westward Ho lasted for decades. Dean Petersen’s passing in 1997 marked the beginning of the end. Despite Faye Johnson, Dean's sister, stepping in to keep operations going, the inevitable sale came in 2005.  Francis Zarro’s American Pastime West LLC purchased the property, but signaled its imminent demise with the announcement of a November 2005 closure.  At the time of its closure, it employed 650 people and boasted a respectable 35,000 square foot casino.

## A Valuable Piece of Land, A Lost Landmark

The land itself proved to be far more valuable than the operating casino. The strategic location, just south of the Strip, caught the eye of Harrah’s Entertainment, who traded it to Boyd Gaming for the [Barbary Coast](/posts/barbary-coast-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/). In 2006, the $101.6 million deal finalized the Westward Ho’s fate.  Boyd’s initial plans for “Echelon Place” never fully materialized due to the Great Recession. The symbolic moment of a McDonald's opening on a corner of the old property felt like the final nail in the coffin for the beloved landmark.

## From 'Ho' to Resorts World

Today, virtually nothing remains of the Westward Ho. The expansive space now houses the sprawling Resorts World complex, a testament to how much Las Vegas has changed. While “The Ho” may be gone, it lives on in the memories of those who experienced its unique charm – a reminder of a time when Las Vegas was a little less flashy, a little more friendly, and a whole lot more rooted in its frontier past. The memory of “The Ho” serves as a valuable piece of Las Vegas history.
