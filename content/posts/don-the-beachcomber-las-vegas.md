# A Desert Oasis: Don the Beachcomber at the Sahara

Las Vegas has always been about spectacle, a place where fantasy and reality blur. And few establishments embodied that ethos quite like Don the Beachcomber, a vibrant Polynesian-themed restaurant and bar that graced the Sahara Hotel & Casino for nearly three decades. Opened on December 1, 1962, it was a dazzling escape from the arid Nevada landscape, a portal to a lush, tropical paradise in the heart of the desert.

## The Legend of Donn Beach and Sunny Sund's Legacy

The story begins with Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt, better known as Donn Beach, the original pioneer of the tiki bar scene. He’d established his influential “Don the Beachcomber” concept in Southern California years earlier, revolutionizing cocktail culture with his complex, rum-based concoctions. However, Donn himself wasn’t involved in the Las Vegas iteration.  That honor fell to his former wife, Sunny Sund, who skillfully carried forward the brand’s beloved aesthetic and exotic menu.  She understood the appeal, and meticulously replicated the immersive experience that had made the original so popular.

## Stepping into Paradise

Entering Don the Beachcomber at the Sahara was unlike anything else on the Strip. Guests left the casino floor behind and found themselves enveloped in a meticulously crafted world. Bamboo walls, intricate tiki carvings, cascading waterfalls, and the soothing sounds of island music created an atmosphere of exotic tranquility.  The décor wasn’t just surface-level; it was a complete immersion, a tangible embodiment of Polynesian escapism.  

## Food, Drink, and Drama

The menu offered a surprising blend. While leaning heavily into Polynesian-inspired dishes, there were also nods to Cantonese cuisine and classic continental fare, reflecting the mid-century American palate’s fascination with the “exotic.”  However, the drinks were undeniably the star of the show. Mai Tais, Zombies, and other potent rum cocktails, often served in elaborate, shared vessels and with theatrical flair (think flaming bowls!), were the main draw. It was a full sensory experience, as much about the presentation as it was about the taste.

## A Golden Age Memory

For decades, Don the Beachcomber was a beloved fixture at the Sahara, providing a welcome respite for conventioneers, honeymooners, and showgoers. It offered an accessible taste of luxury and adventure, solidifying its place in the golden age of Las Vegas dining.  The restaurant closed around 1990 as hotel concepts and tastes shifted, but its memory lives on. Today, Don the Beachcomber at the Sahara stands as a potent symbol of Las Vegas’s mid-century creative heyday - a reminder of a time when themed restaurants were an integral part of the overall entertainment experience and when escaping to a far-off paradise was just a few steps from the casino floor.
