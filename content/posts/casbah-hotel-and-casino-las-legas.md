## A Desert Oasis of Intrigue: The Casbah's Early Years

Few Las Vegas landmarks have a history as colorful and complex as the Casbah Hotel and Casino. Opened in 1963 by the ambitious Danny Jackson, the Casbah aimed to transport visitors to a Moroccan fantasy. Located on the Strip (originally at Sahara Avenue, now the site of Las Vegas City Hall), it was designed to evoke the exotic atmosphere of North Africa, with lush landscaping, ornate fountains, and a distinctive architecture. Jackson envisioned a sophisticated, upscale experience, distinct from the other casinos of the time. While initially successful, the Casbah’s reputation quickly began to tarnish.

It gained a less-than-desirable notoriety for its association with organized crime and a lax attitude towards certain…activities. The Jackson family continued to operate the property after Danny’s passing, but controlling the negative perception proved difficult. The 1970s and early 1980s saw the Casbah struggling to shake off its shadows, becoming a place synonymous with more than just gambling.

## Ann Meyers' Bold Move & A Queen's Transformation

In 1976, a pivotal moment arrived when Ann Meyers, a prominent businesswoman and basketball star, purchased the Casbah. This was a significant event – Meyers became the first woman to own a hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip. Naively, she seemed unaware of the depth of the property’s problems. Recognizing the potential, Meyers embarked on a mission to overhaul the Casbah's image. 

She rebranded it in 1990 as Ann Meyer’s Queen of Hearts Hotel. This wasn't just a name change; it represented a commitment to improved service, a more welcoming atmosphere, and a focus on attracting a wider clientele. Meyers invested in renovations and genuinely tried to improve the guest experience. For a while, it seemed to work, with business steadily increasing and the hotel shedding some of its old skin.

## A Legacy Demolished, Memories Remain

Despite Meyers’ efforts, the Casbah’s past continued to haunt it. Issues surrounding prostitution and violence remained persistent challenges. Ultimately, in 2010, the inevitable announcement came: the Casbah would be demolished to make way for a new Las Vegas City Hall building and business complex. The demolition marked the end of an era for this intriguing piece of Las Vegas history.

The Casbah’s story serves as a powerful reminder of the complexities of Las Vegas's past – a place where dreams and darkness often intertwined. While the physical structure is gone, the memories of the Casbah, and the woman who tried to revive it, live on as a fascinating chapter in the vintage Las Vegas story.
