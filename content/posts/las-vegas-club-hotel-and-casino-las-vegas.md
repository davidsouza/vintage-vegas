# A Downtown Legend: The Las Vegas Club

The Las Vegas Club. Just the name evokes a specific era of Downtown Las Vegas – a time of gritty charm, burgeoning entertainment, and the dawn of themed casino experiences. For 85 years, it stood as an anchor on Fremont Street, a testament to the city's evolving identity. Its closure in 2015 marked the end of an era, but its legacy lives on in the memories of countless visitors and locals.

## Humble Beginnings & a Street Crossing

The story begins in 1930, a pivotal year for both Las Vegas and the burgeoning casino industry. Originally situated at 21-23 Fremont Street, the Las Vegas Club was a modest operation in those early days, quietly carving out its place in the nascent gaming scene. It operated in close proximity to the older, established Las Vegas Hotel. However, in 1949, a significant shift occurred: the Club moved across the street into the Overland Hotel building, a structure dating back to 1905. This relocation intertwined the two properties, a physical manifestation of the merging histories of early Vegas businesses.

## The Gaughan Era & a Sporting Identity

The true transformation of the Las Vegas Club came in 1962 when Jackie Gaughan, a name synonymous with Downtown Las Vegas, acquired it alongside Mel Exber and Larry Hezzelwood. Gaughan's vision was to inject a vibrant, sporty personality into the Club. Recognizing the passion for sports among patrons, he implemented a clever and enduring strategy. Restaurants like “Bullpen” and “Dugout” added to the theme, and a Sports Hall of Fame, overflowing with memorabilia, became a major draw. The exterior was dramatically redesigned to resemble a sports stadium, complete with mirrored panels and a gleaming brass statue of a baseball player—an unforgettable visual marker on Fremont Street.

## Expansion & Continued Popularity

The Club's popularity continued to rise throughout the decades. A substantial $35 million renovation in 1996 brought a modern 16-story tower, expanded the casino floor, and deepened the sports motif with murals and stadium-style elements. At its peak, the Las Vegas Club boasted over 410 hotel rooms, providing a comfortable and themed experience for visitors.

## The Decline & Demolition

Sadly, like many long-standing businesses, the Las Vegas Club eventually faced challenges. Changing times and increased competition led to a decline, and in 2013, the hotel portion closed. The casino persisted for a little longer, but ultimately shut its doors on August 20, 2015. While many hoped for renovation, the site was sold to Derek and Greg Stevens, who ultimately chose demolition. In 2020, the Circa Resort & Casino rose from the ashes, ushering in a new era for Fremont Street.

## A Lasting Legacy

The Las Vegas Club represents far more than just a casino. It’s a microcosm of Downtown Las Vegas’s evolution, from a humble gaming house to a themed spectacle, and finally, a poignant reminder of a bygone era.  The memories of its neon glow, the roar of the crowds, and the thrill of the game will continue to resonate within the heart of Fremont Street, ensuring the Las Vegas Club’s place in vintage Las Vegas lore.
