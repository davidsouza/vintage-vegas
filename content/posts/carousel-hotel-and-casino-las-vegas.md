## A Whirl of Fun: The Carousel's Rise on Fremont Street

Before the mega-resorts and high-roller spectacle, downtown Las Vegas pulsated with a unique, playful energy. A vibrant piece of that history was the Carousel Hotel and Casino, a beloved Fremont Street fixture that operated from 1964 to 1974. Standing prominently on the corner of Fremont and 1st, it was a visual landmark, distinguishable by its bright neon marquee and, of course, its carousel-themed imagery.  It wasn’t about lavish luxury; it was about affordable fun and a genuinely welcoming atmosphere, a stark contrast to the increasingly upscale casinos sprouting along the Strip.

The Carousel’s early years were part of the Spinning Wheel Corporation. It quickly evolved, undergoing several ownership changes, each leaving its mark.  Marty Kaizen briefly rebranded it “Marty’s Carousel,” and a short stint under the McLaney Group saw it operating as “McLaney Carousel.” Ultimately, it settled into its identity as simply “The Carousel Casino.”

## Promotions and Value: What Made the Carousel Special?

The Carousel distinguished itself through a series of delightfully quirky promotions. Guests received five free nickels to try their luck on the slot machines, a small gesture that meant a lot to budget-conscious visitors. But the truly remarkable promotion was the periodic land giveaway. Every 75 days, the casino would raffle off a full acre of Las Vegas land—to anyone, regardless of whether they were even present! Imagine winning a piece of the Vegas landscape just for being a registered patron. This kind of promotion, a hallmark of the era’s playful spirit, attracted significant attention and created a loyal following.

Affordability was also key.  Dining was remarkably inexpensive. You could enjoy a hearty fried chicken, fish and chips, or roast beef dinner for under a dollar! Breakfast plates, complete with ham or sausage and hash browns, were a steal at just 65 cents. This made the Carousel a popular spot for locals and tourists looking for a good meal without breaking the bank.

## The Carousel's Demise and Legacy

Despite its popularity, the Carousel couldn't withstand the evolving landscape of downtown Las Vegas. As the architectural styles shifted and competition increased, the casino was eventually absorbed into larger development plans. It closed its doors in 1974, marking the end of an era. 

Though gone, the Carousel's legacy lives on in the memories of those who experienced its unique charm. The site has since been home to several other casinos, including the Gambler’s Hall of Fame, [Sundance West](/posts/sundance-west-casino-las-vegas/), Sassy Sally’s, and [Mermaids Casino](/posts/mermaids-casino-las-vegas/). Today, it’s part of the impressive Circa Resort & Casino, a testament to the continuous evolution of Las Vegas.  However, for those who remember, the Carousel remains a symbol of a simpler, more playful time on Fremont Street, a true gem of vintage Las Vegas.
