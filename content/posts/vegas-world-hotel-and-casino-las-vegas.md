## A Phoenix Rises: From Ashes to Intergalactic Resort

Before the Stratosphere pierced the Las Vegas skyline, there was Vegas World Hotel & Casino. Opened on July 13, 1979, by the irrepressible Bob Stupak, Vegas World wasn’t just a casino; it was an experience. Stupak famously transformed a burned-out slot parlor into a sprawling, space-themed wonderland, embracing the mantra, “The Sky’s the Limit.” This was a period of Vegas pushing boundaries, and Stupak was at the forefront of the charge. 

Initially, Vegas World was modest – an eight-story hotel with just 90 rooms and a 15,000-square-foot casino. But Stupak had bigger plans. The resort’s rapid expansion reflected the explosive growth of Las Vegas itself, adding towers throughout the 1980s and 1990s, eventually boasting over 900 rooms. 

## More Than Just Games: Stunts, Promotions, and Spectacle

What truly set Vegas World apart was Stupak's penchant for the outrageous. Forget subtle promotions; Vegas World dared to be different. We’re talking about the world’s first $250,000 and $1 million slot jackpots, perpetual discount vacation coupons, and unconventional game variations like “double exposure 21” and “crapless crap.” These weren’t just marketing gimmicks; they were statements – Vegas World was here to have fun and make you do the same. 

And then there were the stunts. In 1984, stuntman Dan Koko became a local legend, executing breathtaking high-fall jumps from the Vegas World rooftop, earning a cool $1 million from Stupak. These spectacles garnered national media attention, with appearances on shows like “60 Minutes” and “Ripley’s Believe It or Not!” 

## A Space-Age Aesthetic

The visual landscape of Vegas World was as bold as its promotions. The interior was a vibrant explosion of space-age décor: murals depicting cosmic scenes, mirrored ceilings, replicas of the Apollo lunar module, astronaut figures, model rockets, and even souvenirs claiming to be moon rocks. It was a truly immersive environment, creating a sense of playful wonder.

## A Legacy Replaced, Not Forgotten

Despite achieving impressive gambling revenues – soaring to around $100 million annually – Stupak’s ambitions extended beyond Vegas World. He envisioned an even more ambitious project: the Stratosphere Tower. Construction began in 1992, directly adjacent to Vegas World. Ultimately, Vegas World closed its doors on February 1, 1995, its hotel towers becoming part of the expanding Stratosphere complex. While the name and visual identity are gone, the legacy of Vegas World remains a vibrant chapter in the history of the Las Vegas Strip, a testament to a time when “tacky” and “bizarre” were celebrated as hallmarks of Vegas innovation.
