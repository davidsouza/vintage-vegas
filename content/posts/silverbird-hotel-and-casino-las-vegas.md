## From [Thunderbird](/posts/thunderbird-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) to Silverbird: A New Vision for Value

The Las Vegas Strip has seen its share of transformations, but few stories are as poignant as that of the Silverbird Hotel and Casino. Originally the Thunderbird Hotel, a long-standing fixture on the Strip, it embarked on a brief but ambitious reinvention in the mid-1970s. In December 1976, Major Riddle, a local businessman, acquired the property with a bold plan: to rename it the Silverbird and revitalize its image.

Riddle’s vision was centered around attracting a different kind of clientele. He felt the Thunderbird had developed a reputation for less-than-stellar food and “tight” slot machines – a serious problem in a town built on entertainment and hospitality. The Silverbird was intended to cater to both local residents and tourists seeking affordable dining and more generous gaming options. Riddle believed the local market had been overlooked, and he planned to capitalize on that. 

## A Grand Expansion and Ambitious Plans

January 1, 1977, marked the official change, though the transition was subtle initially. Riddle’s grand strategy involved a substantial expansion. The casino floor was slated to more than triple in size, from 18,000 to 53,000 square feet, complete with a brand-new sportsbook - a must-have feature in the 1970s Vegas landscape. A new high-rise hotel tower was also in the blueprints, alongside an expanded coffee shop and a lively keno lounge. The commitment to affordability extended to a planned 500-seat buffet, promising a dining experience at a price point appealing to a broader audience.

While initial plans called for a temporary casino closure during the massive renovation, Riddle shrewdly opted to keep it open, understanding the impact of even a short shutdown. Fifty-five hotel rooms were sacrificed to accommodate the sprawling casino expansion, reducing the room count to 385. The aesthetic was a noticeable shift from the Thunderbird’s earlier era, attempting to project a more modern and approachable feel.

## A Tragic End and Lasting Legacy

Sadly, the Silverbird’s story is cut short. Major Riddle’s untimely passing in 1980 threw the future of his casinos, including the Silverbird, into uncertainty. The properties were placed in his estate, which subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Despite attempts at reorganization, a December 1981 auction failed to find a buyer willing to meet the $3.8 million minimum bid. A federal bankruptcy judge ordered the Silverbird’s closure on December 3, 1981, impacting 850 employees. 

The site now stands as the location of the new Fontainebleau Las Vegas resort and casino, a stark contrast to the modest, value-focused establishment that once stood there. While the Silverbird Hotel and Casino may be a memory for many, its brief existence serves as a fascinating reminder of a bygone era in Las Vegas, a time when ambition and affordability intertwined, leaving a subtle but significant mark on the Strip's history.
