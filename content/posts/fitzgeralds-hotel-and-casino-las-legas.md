## From Sundance to Shamrock: The Early Years

Downtown Las Vegas has seen its share of transformations, but few are as fondly remembered as Fitzgeralds Hotel & Casino. Located at 301 Fremont Street, anchoring the eastern end of the Fremont Street Experience, it was a visual landmark and a beloved institution for decades. Its story actually begins in 1980 as the Sundance Hotel, a project brought to life by the vision of Moe Dalitz, along with operators Al Sachs and Herb Tobman – the same powerhouse team behind the Stardust and Fremont casinos. While initially a stylish addition to the Fremont Street scene, its identity was about to take a decidedly Irish turn.

## The Fitzgeralds Era: A Lucky Charm on the Strip

In 1987, Lincoln Management Group / Fitzgeralds Gaming purchased the Sundance and embarked on a rebranding that would define the property for years to come. Gone was the Sundance; in its place rose Fitzgeralds Las Vegas, embracing a playful Irish theme. Think green trim, shamrocks galore, and a grinning cartoon leprechaun – all designed to create a fun, value-oriented alternative to the glitzier casinos further down the Strip. The 34-story tower, one of the tallest in the area at the time, became instantly recognizable, offering spectacular views of the evolving Fremont Street Experience. Inside, a sprawling 42,000-square-foot casino buzzed with activity, boasting a wide selection of slots, table games, keno, and a lively sportsbook. Add to that popular restaurants like a buffet and steakhouse, and you had a winning formula.

## A Milestone and a Refresh

The casino’s history took another significant turn in 2001 when it was sold to Don Barden, marking a historic moment as Barden became the first African American casino owner in Las Vegas. Despite Fitzgeralds Gaming’s larger bankruptcy, Barden invested heavily in renovations, injecting new life into the property. Fresh paint, remodeled dining areas, and showroom upgrades helped revitalize the landmark. 

## Legacy and Rebirth as The D

After Barden’s passing, the property was acquired by the Stevens brothers, owners of the legendary Golden Gate casino. They initiated a $22 million renovation project in 2011, modernizing the casino and hotel rooms while preserving the structure’s iconic tower. While the Irish theme was retired in 2012 with the rebranding to The D Las Vegas, Fitzgeralds’ impact on downtown remains undeniable. Though the shamrocks and leprechauns are no longer visible, the core of Fitzgeralds lives on, a testament to a classic era of Fremont Street – a time of value gaming, quirky theming, and a vibrant downtown scene. For many longtime visitors, Fitzgeralds represents a piece of vintage Las Vegas that will never be forgotten.
