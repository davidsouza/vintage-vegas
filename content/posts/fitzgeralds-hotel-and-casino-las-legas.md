## From [Sundance](/posts/sundance-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) to Shamrock: The Early Years

[Fitzgeralds Hotel and Casino](/posts/fitzgeralds-hotel-and-casino/), a familiar sight on the eastern edge of Fremont Street, didn’t always bear that beloved name. Its story begins in 1980 as the Sundance Hotel, a project spearheaded by the legendary Moe Dalitz and operating partners Al Sachs and Herb Tobman, a powerful trio also connected to the [Stardust](/posts/stardust-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) and Fremont casinos. The Sundance quickly became a vital piece of the burgeoning downtown Las Vegas landscape. It was a time of rapid growth for Fremont Street, still very much the heart of Las Vegas entertainment. The tower’s impressive 34 stories immediately made it a notable landmark, offering guests fantastic views of the bustling street and the ever-evolving neon scene.

## Embracing the Irish Spirit

The real transformation came in 1987 when Reno-based Lincoln Management Group, operating as Fitzgeralds Gaming, purchased the Sundance. They made a bold move, rebranding it as [Fitzgeralds Las Vegas](/posts/fitzgeralds-las-vegas/) and imbuing it with a distinctly Irish identity. Suddenly, shamrocks sprouted everywhere, green trim adorned the exterior, and a cheerful cartoon leprechaun became the casino's mascot. This playful, value-oriented branding was a deliberate strategy, offering a contrast to the increasingly high-roller focused Las Vegas Strip. Fitzgeralds became known for its accessible gaming, lively atmosphere, and affordability.  It was *the* place to be for a fun, budget-friendly Vegas experience. The casino floor offered a 42,000-square-foot playground of slots, table games, keno, and a popular sportsbook, and the restaurants, particularly the buffet and steakhouse, were always buzzing.

## A Milestone & Revitalization

The early 2000s brought challenges, including Fitzgeralds Gaming’s bankruptcy. However, a significant moment arrived with the purchase by Don Barden, a Detroit-based entrepreneur who made history as the first African American casino owner in Las Vegas. Barden’s investment injected new life into the property with renovations and upgrades, stabilizing its place in the downtown market.  His efforts were cut short by his untimely passing, but his legacy of revitalizing Fitzgeralds remains important.

## The D & A Lasting Legacy

In 2011, brothers Derek and Greg Stevens, already owners of the [Golden Gate](/posts/golden-gate-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/), acquired Fitzgeralds. They initiated a $22 million renovation project, modernizing the casino and guest rooms while retaining the original tower. In 2012, the property officially became The D Las Vegas, marking the end of an era for Fitzgeralds. While the vibrant green and playful leprechauns are long gone, the bones of Fitzgeralds live on. The D's casino and structure are a direct continuation of the original property. For many who remember those days, Fitzgeralds represents a quintessential vintage Las Vegas experience: a time of value, quirky theming, and a unique personality watching over the dazzling Fremont Street Experience. It’s a memory fondly held by longtime downtown regulars and a reminder of the ever-evolving story of Las Vegas.
