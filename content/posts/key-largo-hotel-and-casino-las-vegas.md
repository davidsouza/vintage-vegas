## A Shifting Identity: From Ambassador to Key Largo

The corner of East Flamingo Road and [Paradise](/posts/paradise-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Road has seen a lot of change over the decades, but for many vintage Las Vegas enthusiasts, the memory of the Key Largo Hotel and Casino holds a certain nostalgic charm. Its journey wasn't straightforward, marked by multiple name changes and a slow fade into oblivion. Originally opening in 1974 as the Ambassador Inn, it was a modest motel catering to travelers looking for affordable lodging a little removed from the glitz and glamour of the burgeoning Las Vegas Strip.  The addition of a casino in 1978 signaled an attempt to capitalize on Nevada’s booming gambling industry.  It was known then simply as the [Ambassador Casino](/posts/ambassador-casino-las-vegas/).  Subsequent iterations included the Paradise Inn and the Quality Inn Key Largo Casino, each reflecting a period of shifting ownership and rebranding attempts.

## A Quiet Corner, A Loyal Clientele

While never a major player on the Las Vegas Strip, the Key Largo carved out a unique niche. Located about a mile east of the main action, it offered a more relaxed and less pretentious atmosphere than many of its high-roller focused neighbors. It wasn't a place for elaborate shows or celebrity sightings; instead, it fostered a comfortable, familiar feel for its regulars.  Think a classic, older-style casino - the kind where you might strike up a conversation with your neighbor at the slot machines. The hotel rooms were simple, the prices reasonable, and the overall vibe was one of understated authenticity.  This appeal particularly drew a local clientele who appreciated the down-to-earth atmosphere and more generous odds often found at smaller casinos.

## The Key Largo Era & The Inevitable Decline

The name "Key Largo" stuck around from 1997, coinciding with a brief attempt at updating the property's aesthetics. Despite the name change, the casino struggled to compete with the more robust operations of Ellis Island and Terrible's – both close enough to draw away patrons.  The location's distance from the Strip proved to be a constant hurdle. By 2005, the owners decided to shutter the Key Largo on January 18th, envisioning a high-rise residential project to take its place.  However, those grand plans never materialized, leaving the building to languish for years as an empty shell, a silent testament to unfulfilled ambition.

## A Tragic End & Lasting Memory

The Key Largo’s story took a dramatic turn in 2013 when a fire, tragically caused by someone attempting to steal copper wiring, ravaged the building. The irony was stark – a building already fading into obscurity was further diminished by a destructive act.  The remaining structure was demolished in October of that year, erasing it completely from the landscape. Anthony Curtis, publisher of the *Las Vegas Advisor,* famously said it wouldn't be sorely missed, and while the Key Largo may not have been a landmark, its disappearance nonetheless marked the end of an era for a certain segment of Las Vegas history. Today, the lot remains vacant, a stark reminder of what once was. While it may be gone, the Key Largo Hotel and Casino's legacy lives on in the memories of those who appreciated its quiet charm and the enduring appeal of vintage Las Vegas.
