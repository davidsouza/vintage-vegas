# A Quirky Chapter: The Story of Key Largo Hotel and Casino

The Las Vegas Strip has always been about spectacle and reinvention, but just a mile east, on East Flamingo Road, a quieter, slightly offbeat history unfolded at the Key Largo Hotel and Casino. While not a Strip titan, Key Largo held a unique place in the hearts of many Vegas locals and those seeking an alternative to the glitz and glamour downtown. Its story, spanning from 1974 to 2013, is a microcosm of Vegas's evolution and eventual obsolescence.

## From Ambassador to Key Largo: A Changing Identity

The property originally debuted in 1974 as the Ambassador Inn, a standard motel catering to budget-conscious travelers. In 1978, mirroring the era’s casino boom, a casino was added, transforming it into the Ambassador Casino. Ownership and branding shifted several times over the decades. It briefly became the Quality Inn Key Largo Casino, reflecting a common branding strategy for the chain. The name 'Key Largo' stuck, however, and eventually became the permanent moniker in 1997, likely aiming to evoke a tropical, relaxed feel—a welcome respite from the hectic Strip.

## What Made Key Largo Special?

Key Largo never chased the high-roller crowd. Its appeal lay in its simplicity and affordability. It fostered a loyal, working-class clientele who appreciated its casual atmosphere and often generous player incentives. The casino itself wasn't sprawling, but it offered familiar games and a comfortable, unpretentious environment. Its location, just off the Strip, made it easily accessible, yet distinct enough to offer a different vibe. Think of it as a friendly neighborhood spot rather than a destination resort. Local legends recall decent food at the casino restaurant and a generally laid-back atmosphere that’s hard to find these days.

## A Tragic End and Vacant Legacy

The Key Largo’s story ended abruptly on January 18, 2005, when it closed its doors to make way for a planned high-rise development. Unfortunately, the development never materialized, leaving the property to decay and become a ghostly reminder of what once was. A particularly sad chapter unfolded in 2013 when a fire, accidentally started by a copper thief, significantly damaged the structure. The fire served as the final nail in the coffin, and the remaining shell of Key Largo was demolished later that year.

As Anthony Curtis of the Las Vegas Advisor observed at the time, Key Largo wasn’t a massive loss in the grand scheme of things. But for those who appreciated its humble charm and dependable value, its disappearance marked another piece of vintage Las Vegas vanishing into the desert sand. Today, the property remains vacant, a silent testament to a bygone era of budget-friendly Vegas experiences and a reminder that even seemingly insignificant landmarks can hold a special place in the city’s history.
