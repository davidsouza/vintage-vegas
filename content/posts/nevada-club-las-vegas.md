## From Turf Club to Nevada Icon

The mid-1950s Las Vegas Strip was a landscape of constant change, acquisition, and reinvention. In 1952, the story of what would become the legendary Nevada Club began with the purchase of the Santa Anita Turf Club. While the Turf Club had existed previously, the new ownership breathed fresh life into the property, officially opening as the Nevada Club. It was a period of rapid expansion; new casinos popped up regularly, each vying to capture the attention (and wallets) of burgeoning tourist traffic. The Nevada Club, located on Fremont Street, quickly became one of those contenders.

## A Changing of the Guard and a Unified Front

The casino landscape was already fiercely competitive. Just two years later, in 1954, the Nevada Club changed hands. This period was typical of early Las Vegas—properties often traded and morphed as entrepreneurs sought opportunities. Then, in 1955, Robert Van Santen entered the scene, acquiring the club and immediately orchestrating a significant shift. Van Santen recognized the power of synergy and merged the Nevada Club with the neighboring Fortune Club, creating a larger, more formidable establishment under the familiar Nevada Club banner.  A year later, they absorbed a Western Union office, further consolidating the block.

## The Great Las Vegas Slot Machine War

Robert Van Santen wasn't just interested in size; he was a visionary when it came to gambling, particularly slot machines. Recognizing their potential for drawing crowds and generating revenue, Van Santen initiated what would become known as "The Great Las Vegas Slot Machine War."  He started offering significantly higher jackpots than competitors, a bold move that challenged the established norms.  But it wasn't just about the money. Van Santen introduced innovative features – bells on the machines, and most notably, revolving-light beacons – to create a more engaging and visually stimulating experience. These sensory enhancements were revolutionary and became standard practice in the industry.  The design of the machines themselves contributed to the excitement. Their hollow payoff trays amplified the clatter of falling coins, a seductive sound that lured gamblers from blocks away.

## Diamond Jim’s and a Final Chapter

In 1962, the Nevada Club underwent another name change, becoming Diamond Jim’s Nevada Club, accompanied by a prominent 75-foot marquee. The name was a nod to Diamond Jim Brady, a famed San Francisco bon vivant and gourmand. While the club continued to operate, the sands of time were shifting.  In 1969, the Nevada Club was purchased by the Golden Nugget, marking the end of an era. Though the name disappeared, the property remains an integral part of the Golden Nugget complex, a silent testament to its vibrant past.
