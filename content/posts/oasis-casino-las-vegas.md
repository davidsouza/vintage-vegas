## A Modern Refresh for a Vegas Legend: The [Dunes](/posts/dunes-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) & the Oasis Casino

The early 1980s were a time of rapid change and intense competition on the Las Vegas Strip. The Dunes Hotel & Casino, a beloved and iconic Arabian-themed resort, was showing its age. Seeking a revitalization and a much-needed boost in capacity, the property embarked on a bold project: the Oasis Casino.

Opened in August 1982 at the bustling intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road, the Oasis was a striking architectural departure from the Dunes’ original Moorish design. Its sleek, black mirrored-glass facade screamed modern – a clear statement of intent to attract a new generation of casino-goers. This wasn’t subtle renovation; it was a bold expansion, adding approximately 18,000 square feet of gaming space to the resort.

## The Neon Palms: A Symbol of 80s Vegas

But the Oasis wasn't just about the glass and steel. It was the monumental neon palm trees that truly cemented its place in Vegas history. Designed by Jack DuBois of YESCO, based on initial concepts by Raul Rodriguez, these towering palms – soaring 70 feet high with 20-foot fronds – were a spectacle. Illuminated in layered greens and yellows, they created a futuristic, tropical vibe that made the Oasis instantly recognizable and photographable. They became a defining symbol of early 80s Las Vegas.

## More Than Just a Casino Expansion

Inside, the Oasis functioned as a seamless extension of the Dunes’ existing casino. It featured a brighter, more contemporary atmosphere, offering a range of slot machines and table games. It was an attempt to keep pace with the rapid modernization happening across the Strip, as neighboring properties underwent massive rebuilds. The upper level of the Oasis building, however, remained unfinished and unused, a curious quirk that always intrigued visitors.

## A Brief but Memorable Legacy

The Oasis Casino's reign was relatively short-lived. When the Dunes itself was sold in 1993, the property was slated for demolition to make way for the Bellagio. The Oasis Casino, along with the rest of the Dunes, closed its doors. The iconic neon palm trees, sadly, were sold off during the liquidation process. They experienced a surprising journey, finding a new home in Bangkok, Thailand, as part of the entrance to the NASA nightclub. Their current whereabouts remain a mystery.

Today, the site where the Oasis Casino once stood is part of the Bellagio’s breathtaking lake and fountains. Though gone, the Oasis Casino remains a powerful reminder of a distinctive era in Las Vegas history – a time when mirrored glass, bold neon, and a desire for innovation shaped the legendary Las Vegas Strip.
