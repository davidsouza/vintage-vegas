## A Modern [Mirage](/posts/mirage-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Amidst Arabian Nights

The early 1980s were a period of intense competition on the Las Vegas Strip. Resorts were battling for dominance, and the [Dunes](/posts/dunes-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Hotel & Casino, a landmark known for its Arabian Nights theme, felt the pressure. While the Dunes held a rich history, it was beginning to feel dated against the backdrop of increasingly modern resorts. Enter the Oasis Casino, a bold and almost jarring addition intended to revitalize the aging property.

Opened in August 1982, the Oasis wasn’t just a casino expansion; it was a statement. Located at the busy intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road – a prime piece of Strip real estate – the Oasis was a distinctly modern response to the Dunes’ established aesthetic. Constructed of sleek, black mirrored glass, it stood in stark contrast to the low-slung, Arabian-inspired buildings of the original hotel. The 18,000 square feet of new gaming space significantly boosted the Dunes’ capacity and, crucially, presented a fresh, modern face to the world.

## Neon Palms and Futuristic Flair

While the building itself was a statement of contemporary design, it was the exterior signage that truly captured the essence of the Oasis. The iconic neon palm trees, designed by Jack DuBois of YESCO based on earlier concepts by Raul Rodriguez, were a spectacle. Towering 70 feet high, with fronds stretching approximately 20 feet, the palms weren’t just decorative; they were a deliberate attempt to evoke a futuristic tropical [paradise](/posts/paradise-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/). The layered greens and yellows of the neon illuminated the Strip at night, creating an unforgettable visual impact.  The sheer scale of the palms, coupled with the modern architectural style, represented a significant departure from the traditional Vegas aesthetic.

## More Than Just a Casino

The Oasis functioned as an extension of the Dunes' primary casino, offering a brighter, more contemporary feel.  It wasn’t intended to replace the original experience, but to augment it, catering to a more contemporary clientele. While the building had two stories, only the ground floor was operational, leaving the upper level unused – a curious architectural choice that remains a point of fascination for Vegas historians.

## A Fleeting Legacy

Sadly, the Oasis Casino’s time was short-lived. In 1993, the Dunes Hotel & Casino closed its doors to make way for the luxurious Bellagio.  The Oasis, along with the rest of the Dunes, vanished as part of this grand transformation. During the liquidation process, the beloved neon palm trees were purchased by YESCO and later resurfaced in Bangkok, Thailand, adorning the entrance to the NASA nightclub.  While they’ve since disappeared again, their presence in Thailand serves as a quirky reminder of the Oasis’s transcontinental journey.

Today, the site of the Oasis Casino is seamlessly integrated into Bellagio’s magnificent lake and resort complex.  Though physically gone, the Oasis Casino remains a vibrant image in the collective memory of vintage Las Vegas, a striking snapshot of early-’80s Strip style, and a testament to the constant evolution of the Las Vegas landscape.
