The Las Vegas Strip has always been a landscape of constant change, a relentless churn of new hotels, casinos, and experiences replacing the old. While many casinos leave a lasting mark on the city's identity, some flicker and fade, leaving behind only whispers of what once was. The Riata Casino is one such forgotten gem.

## A Short Run on the Strip (1973-1974)

Opened in July 1973, the Riata Casino occupied a prime location at 3001 Las Vegas Boulevard South, nestled within the Las Vegas Plaza shopping center. Its origins were rooted in a deal brokered by Minneapolis investors who acquired the property from the Kishner family. Strategically positioned across from the massive [Stardust](/posts/stardust-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) Hotel & Casino, the Riata seemed poised for success. However, despite its desirable location, the casino struggled to find its footing, facing financial headwinds from the get-go. It was a sign of the times; the mid-70s saw fluctuating economic conditions, and new casinos constantly vying for customer attention. Less than a year later, in August 1974, the Riata abruptly closed its doors.

## From Cowtown to [Silver City](/posts/silver-city-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/)

The Riata’s story doesn’t end with its closure. Enter Major Riddle, a shrewd businessman who recognized the potential of the location. Riddle purchased the property and, with a bold vision, transformed the space into the Silver City Casino. The name and theme were a complete departure from the Riata's original aesthetic. Embracing the Wild West, Silver City brought a rustic, Old West charm to the Strip – a stark contrast to the increasingly glitzy and modern casinos that were beginning to dominate the landscape.

## Affordable Gaming & A Smoking Ban Pioneer

Silver City quickly carved out a niche for itself by offering remarkably affordable gaming options. Craps at 10 cents and roulette at 25 cents were unheard of on the Las Vegas Strip, attracting a different kind of player – those looking for value and a fun, low-pressure environment.  But the casino’s legacy extends beyond its affordability. In 1991, Silver City made history as the *first* casino on the Las Vegas Strip to ban smoking. This pioneering move, while controversial at the time, foreshadowed a wider shift in attitudes toward public health and ultimately paved the way for smoking bans throughout the city.

## A Forgotten Chapter

Today, the Riata Casino’s name is largely absent from popular memory. The Las Vegas Plaza and the original Riata structure were demolished in 2004, replaced by Silver City Plaza.  While the spirit of Silver City lived on in a smaller casino further down the strip for a while, the original location remains a concrete reminder of a bygone era – a brief, forgotten chapter in Las Vegas’s ever-evolving story. It serves as a poignant illustration of the fleeting nature of many businesses on the Strip and a testament to the fact that even a short-lived venture can contribute to the rich tapestry of Las Vegas history.
