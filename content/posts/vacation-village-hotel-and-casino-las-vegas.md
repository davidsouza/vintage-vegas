## A Long Time Coming: The Dream of Vacation Village

Just south of the glittering main Las Vegas Strip, nestled on a plot of land initially acquired by the Heers family as early as 1964, sat a resort that epitomized a different era of Vegas: the Vacation Village Hotel and Casino. While the Strip was becoming increasingly synonymous with opulent mega-resorts, Vacation Village carved out a niche as a more modest, value-driven escape. The story of its realization, however, was anything but straightforward. Initial plans emerged in the 1970s, only to stall. It wasn't until 1988 that the project was revived, finally debuting in November 1990.

## Southwest Charm and Unique Attractions

Vacation Village offered 315 rooms and a 15,000-square-foot casino, leaning heavily into a Southwest-inspired design. It wasn't attempting to compete with the grandeur of the [Mirage](/posts/mirage-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/) or Luxor; instead, it targeted locals and budget-conscious tourists. What *did* set it apart? A quirky collection of amenities! The “graveyard buffet,” complete with tombstone décor, was a memorably unusual dining experience. Value-driven promotions and coupon books were hugely popular, solidifying its appeal. Later additions like a 24-hour buffet and a large banquet room further expanded its offerings. By the mid-90s, Denny’s, Great China Buffet, a bingo hall, race book, wedding chapel, and even a liquor store joined the mix - a surprisingly eclectic combination even for Vegas.

## Trials and Tribulations

The resort's journey was marred by setbacks. A devastating arson in 1992, occurring during construction, significantly delayed progress. Furthermore, new airport runway height restrictions forced costly redesigns. Financial struggles soon followed, culminating in a staggering $19 million loan and a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in 2001. The property was ultimately auctioned and passed into the hands of Shawn Scott.

## A Brief Farewell and a New Beginning

Vacation Village’s run ended abruptly on January 8, 2002, leaving 350 employees out of work and displacing 66 guests. While its time was short, it remains a memorable, if often overlooked, piece of Las Vegas history. The land wasn't dormant for long. In 2004, Turnberry Associates and Centra Properties acquired the site, transforming it into the vibrant Town Square shopping center. While the neon glow of the Vacation Village is now a memory, its legacy lives on as a testament to the diverse and ever-changing landscape of Las Vegas – a reminder that even smaller, quirky establishments can leave a lasting impression on the city’s story.
