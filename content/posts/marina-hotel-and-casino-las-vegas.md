## A Turquoise Dream on the Strip

The Las Vegas Strip has seen countless transformations over the decades, but few stories are as fascinating – and as bittersweet – as that of the Marina Hotel & Casino. Built in 1975, the Marina was more than just another hotel; it was a bold statement of ambition and a unique reflection of the mid-70s Vegas aesthetic. Its distinctive turquoise facade and nautical theme, a stark contrast to the predominantly desert tones of the surrounding landscape, made it instantly recognizable and a beloved fixture on the Strip.

## From Golf Club to Mariner to Marina

The story begins earlier than 1975, though. The land the Marina occupied was originally home to the Golf Club Motel. In the early 70s, Clark County Commissioner Tom Wiesner, through his Southwest Securities Development Company, saw the potential for something much larger. Plans were drawn for a full-fledged hotel and casino, and the adjacent Golf Club Motel was soon rebranded as the Mariner. That brief stint as the Mariner illustrates the rapid evolution of Las Vegas at the time; the desire to upgrade and reposition was constant.  Wiesner Investment Company ultimately built the Marina, ushering in a new era for the property. The grand opening on May 1, 1975, was a significant event, promising 714 rooms, a casino, and exciting dining and entertainment options.

## The Early Years: Argent & Fred Harvey

Initially, Argent Corporation, led by Allen Glick, handled the casino operations while the renowned Fred Harvey Company managed the hotel, restaurants, and other public spaces. This collaboration brought a level of sophistication and service that was becoming increasingly important as Las Vegas sought to attract a more upscale clientele. The entertainment lounge hosted a variety of performers, adding to the Marina’s allure.  The nautical theme extended throughout the hotel, creating a playful and immersive environment.  Sadly, the adjacent Golf Club Motel/Mariner was demolished in 1986, sacrificed to create much-needed parking for the increasingly popular Marina.

## Financial Troubles & a Final Sale

Like many Las Vegas ventures, the Marina's journey wasn't without its turbulence. By 1987, the hotel faced serious financial challenges, with substantial debts to the IRS and Southwest Securities. A brief casino closure in April 1987 underscored the precariousness of the situation. Ultimately, in 1989, Wiesner, along with his partners, sold the Marina to Kirk Kerkorian’s MGM Grand, Inc., alongside the Tropicana Country Club. This marked the end of an era for Wiesner’s vision.

## From Marina to MGM Grand West Wing

Kerkorian's grand plan was to build a massive MGM Grand Hotel and Theme Park, and the Marina’s prime location made it an ideal piece of the puzzle.  In January 1990, the Marina was purchased for $80 million and transformed into the MGM Marina.  Just a few months later, on November 30, 1990, the Marina officially closed its doors as an independent entity, becoming the West Wing of the new, sprawling MGM Grand.

The vibrant turquoise landmark vanished, swallowed up by the ever-expanding MGM Grand, but its legacy remains. The Marina Hotel & Casino served as a memorable chapter in the ongoing saga of Las Vegas, a testament to ambition, change, and the relentless evolution of the Strip.
