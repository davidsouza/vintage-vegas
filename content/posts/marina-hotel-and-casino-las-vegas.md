# A Slice of Mid-70s Vegas: The Rise of the Marina Hotel

The Las Vegas Strip has seen countless transformations, but few stories are as poignant as that of the Marina Hotel and Casino. Built in 1975, the Marina wasn’t just another hotel; it represented a moment in Vegas history, a shift toward larger-scale resorts while still retaining a certain retro charm. Conceived by Tom Wiesner, and developed by his Wiesner Investment Company, the Marina sprung from the ashes of the older Golf Club Motel (which later briefly became the Mariner). Its opening on May 1st, 1975, marked a significant expansion of the Strip’s offerings, boasting 714 rooms spread across 14 floors, along with a bustling casino, two restaurants, and a lively entertainment lounge.

## A Blend of Management and Ambition

Initially, Argent Corporation, led by Allen Glick, managed the casino operations, bringing a taste of established gaming expertise to the new property. The renowned Fred Harvey Company, famed for their hospitality and restaurant service, handled the hotel and dining aspects, promising a level of service that distinguished the Marina from some of its competitors. This partnership aimed to capture both the gambling and leisure markets. The proximity to the Golf Club Motel’s reimagined Mariner added a unique transitional feel to the area.

## Turbulent Times and a Changing Landscape

The late 1980s brought financial challenges. Mounting debt, including significant arrears to the IRS and Southwest Securities, placed the Marina in a precarious position. A bankruptcy filing in March 1987, followed by a temporary casino closure, highlighted the vulnerabilities inherent in the competitive Las Vegas landscape. While the Marina clung on, its fate was ultimately sealed.

## Absorption into the MGM Empire

In a pivotal moment, Wiesner and his partners sold the Marina to Kirk Kerkorian’s MGM Grand, Inc. in 1989, alongside the [Tropicana Country Club](/posts/tropicana-country-club-las-vegas/). Kerkorian’s vision was ambitious: to create the sprawling MGM Grand Hotel and Theme Park we know today. The $80 million acquisition, finalized in January 1990, marked the end of an era for the Marina. It was rebranded as the MGM Marina and closed its doors for a final time on November 30, 1990, becoming the West Wing of the burgeoning MGM Grand.

## A Legacy of Retro Cool

Though the Marina Hotel and Casino is now just a memory, its legacy lives on. It represents a vital chapter in Las Vegas history, a bridge between the classic, intimate casinos of the past and the mega-resort era.  The echoes of its lively casino, sophisticated dining, and vibrant entertainment can still be felt when reflecting on the evolution of the Las Vegas Strip. Today, the Marina's footprint serves as a parking lot for the MGM Grand, but the stories of its heyday continue to intrigue those fascinated by vintage Las Vegas.
