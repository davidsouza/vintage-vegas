## A Bold Expansion: Bringing Vegas East

The Las Vegas Strip has always been the undeniable focal point of Nevada's gaming industry. But for years, Boyd Gaming (and before them, Cannery Casino Resorts) sought to expand that reach, tapping into the underserved local market further east. The Eastside Cannery Casino and Hotel, rising along the Boulder Highway in August 2008, was the embodiment of that ambition. Built on the site of the former Nevada Palace, the $250 million development aimed to provide a full-service hotel-casino experience to East Valley residents, a demographic often overlooked in the Strip-centric glitz. This marked a significant effort to solidify the "Boulder Strip" as a competitive gaming destination.

## Industrial Chic and Modern Design

The Eastside Cannery’s aesthetic was deliberately unique. It rejected the over-the-top theming common in many Vegas casinos, opting instead for an industrial-themed design. Exposed steel trusses, a distinctive "saw-tooth" roofline, and floor-to-ceiling windows in the guest rooms provided a modern, almost warehouse-like feel, softened by mid-century modern design elements. The 16-story tower offered 307 rooms, a welcome addition to the area. The casino itself, spanning roughly 64,000 square feet, bustled with over 2,000 slot machines, 26 table games, a bustling bingo hall, and a race and sports book. It was a substantial operation, intended to be a serious contender in the local gaming landscape.

## A Short-Lived Era & The Pandemic's Impact

For a little over a decade, the Eastside Cannery operated, serving its local clientele and contributing to the vibrancy of the Boulder Strip. However, like so many businesses, its existence was abruptly curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, Nevada casinos were ordered to close, and the Eastside Cannery never reopened its doors. While Boyd Gaming acquired Cannery Casino Resorts in 2016, maintaining a stake in the property, the writing seemed to be on the wall, even with their initial purchase of the land in early 2025 for $45 million.

## Demolition & Future Plans – A Final Chapter

Now, in late October 2025, the final chapter in the Eastside Cannery’s story has been written. Boyd Gaming announced plans to demolish the structure, paving the way for the sale of the 29.5-acre property for future residential development. The company cited continued unfavorable market conditions as the reason for this decision, a stark reminder of the ever-shifting sands of the Las Vegas economy. While the Eastside Cannery’s physical presence will soon be gone, it remains a footnote in the history of Las Vegas, a symbol of ambition, a unique design, and the challenges of thriving in a fiercely competitive market. It represents a brief, bright spark on the Eastside, one that ultimately couldn’t endure.
