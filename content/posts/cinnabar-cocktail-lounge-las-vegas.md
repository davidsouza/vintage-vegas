## A Frontier Vibe in the Neon Heart of Vegas

Las Vegas. The name conjures images of glittering casinos, extravagant shows, and non-stop action. But before the mega-resorts and sprawling complexes, there was a different kind of Vegas – a scrappy, character-driven town fueled by saloons, cocktail lounges, and a distinct Western spirit. Among these pioneers was the Cinnabar Cocktail Lounge, a place that offered a uniquely authentic experience in a city rapidly transforming into the entertainment capital of the world.

## From 1st Street to Fremont's Doorstep

The Cinnabar Cocktail Lounge first opened its doors on South 1st Street in the 1940s. However, it was its 1947 relocation to 122 North 2nd Street that truly cemented its place in Las Vegas history. Situated just a stone's throw from the burgeoning Fremont Street corridor, the Cinnabar perfectly positioned itself to capitalize on the post-war boom and the burgeoning tourist trade. 

The lounge styled itself as “Truly Western,” a deliberate effort to stand apart from the increasingly glamorous (and expensive) casinos popping up around the city. Think wood-paneled interiors, evocative frontier motifs, and a relaxed, welcoming atmosphere. It was a no-frills establishment, a place where locals and visitors alike could unwind with a drink and enjoy a bit of down-home hospitality.

## Neon, Food, and a Rooftop Beacon

The Cinnabar’s visual appeal was undeniable. Its distinctive neon signage – a creation of the renowned Young Electric Sign Company (YESCO) – instantly caught the eye, particularly at night. And it wasn't just about the sign; the lounge sported a rooftop beacon light that served as a literal beacon, drawing late-night crowds from blocks away. 

As the Cinnabar’s popularity grew, so did its ambitions. In the early 1950s, the owners expanded, adding a neighboring eatery, the Cinnabar Restaurant. This pairing offered a complete experience: a hearty meal followed by expertly mixed cocktails – a winning formula for a downtown audience. Their marketing emphasized this local, authentic appeal, a welcome contrast to the burgeoning glitz.

## A Vanishing Piece of Vegas’s Soul

Sadly, the Cinnabar's reign was relatively short-lived. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, it had faded from the city directories, a victim of the rapid modernization sweeping through Las Vegas. The block it occupied, along with its distinctive buildings, was eventually absorbed into the ever-expanding Golden Nugget complex, effectively erasing its physical presence.

Despite its disappearance, the Cinnabar Cocktail Lounge’s legacy lives on. Postcards, matchbooks, and faded photographs serve as reminders of a bygone era. It represents a pivotal moment in Las Vegas's development—a time when simple saloons and neon-lit bars helped build the foundation for the entertainment mecca we know today.  It's a vital piece of the puzzle that helps us understand the evolution of "old Vegas," a story of grit, neon, and the enduring allure of the American West.
