The name might not immediately ring a bell for many modern Vegas visitors, but for those who remember the early 1980s, it represents a short, sharp, and ultimately tragic chapter in Las Vegas’s ever-evolving story. Opened on July 3, 1979, along Boulder Highway, the Palace was a venture spearheaded by casino veteran Gene Lucas, along with Robert Mariscal, Bill Gallagher, Dan Straub, and Rene Diaz. They envisioned a mid-tier property aiming for a friendly, approachable vibe – a contrast to the increasingly opulent and high-roller-focused Strip. Initially boasting just 100 hotel rooms and 15,000 square feet of casino space, it offered a modest, yet seemingly viable, gaming experience.</p><h2 id=a-rocky-start--chapter-11-chaos>A Rocky Start & Chapter 11 Chaos</h2><p>The early optimism proved fleeting. Just a year after opening, Lucas departed, and the Palace began spiraling. 1980 brought a swift descent into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The situation became so dire that creditors forced a one-day closure in July and a full 10-month shutdown of the casino operations. It was a brutal reminder of the high-stakes gamble inherent in the Vegas business. Ownership shuffled repeatedly, further contributing to the instability. This period perfectly encapsulates the chaotic, boom-and-bust cycle that often characterized the off-Strip casinos of that era. The Palace&rsquo;s early troubles highlighted the challenges of competing in a market increasingly dominated by lavish resorts.</p><h2 id=a-second-chance--a-new-look>A Second Chance & a New Look</h2><p>A flicker of hope emerged in late 1985 when William Wortman and Renate Schiff took over. They injected new life into the property, expanding it with a new tower to increase the hotel room count beyond 200. While the Palace never achieved the iconic status of its Strip counterparts, Wortman&rsquo;s investment temporarily stabilized its position. For a time, it continued operating, catering to a local crowd and budget-conscious travelers.</p><h2 id=a-brief-legacy--neon-preservation>A Brief Legacy & Neon Preservation</h2><p>In 2005, Wortman bought out Schiff, then promptly sold the Nevada Palace to Cannery Casino Resorts. However, its fate was sealed. In February 2008, the hotel closed its doors for the final time. Soon after, the Palace was demolished to make way for the <a href=/posts/eastside-cannery-casino-las-vegas/>Eastside Cannery</a> Hotel and Casino, which opened in August 2008. Though the structure itself vanished, a piece of its legacy lives on. The top logo portion of the Nevada Palace’s distinctive neon sign was thankfully rescued and now proudly displays its vintage charm at the Las Vegas Neon Museum, a testament to the fading allure of old Vegas. Importantly, many employees were absorbed into the Eastside Cannery workforce, demonstrating a commitment to the local community, even amidst the demolition.</p><p>Today, the site of the Nevada Palace is the front parking lot for the Eastside Cannery along Boulder Highway, a stark reminder of the relentless cycle of development and change that defines Las Vegas.</p><div class=shop-collection><h2>🎰 Shop the Nevada Palace Hotel and Casino Las Vegas Collection</h2><div class=shop-links><a href=https://vintagevegasshirts.com/product/nevada-palace-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas-triblend-tee/ class=shop-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Triblend Tee</a>
