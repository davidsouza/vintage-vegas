Back in the late 1960s, it was still evolving, finding its identity. Enter the Royal Inn Hotel and Casino, a property that, while modest compared to the giants already present, represents a fascinating snapshot of that era. Construction began in August 1969, a flurry of activity marking its debut. On April 19, 1970, the Royal Inn opened its doors, a 12-story, 200-room hotel nestled on six acres just east of the main Strip. It was part of the Royal Inns of America chain, a national brand aiming to capture a piece of the burgeoning hospitality market. At $3 million, it was a relatively modest investment, reflecting its intention to cater to a different kind of traveler – one seeking affordability and convenience rather than lavish extravagance.</p><h2 id=a-management-shift--early-success>A Management Shift & Early Success</h2><p>The Royal Inn wasn’t meant to remain solely under the umbrella of Royal Inns of America for long. In 1972, the casino operations were taken over by the dynamic duo of Michael Gaughan and Frank Toti. Gaughan, a name familiar to Las Vegas history buffs, brought a keen business sense and a commitment to quality that helped sustain the property throughout the 1970s. While the Royal Inn never aspired to be a high-roller destination, it built a loyal following through friendly service and a reliable gaming experience. The smaller size, compared to the increasingly grandiose hotels popping up, actually had its appeal – it felt less overwhelming and more approachable.</p><h2 id=rebranding-and-a-short-turbulent-run>Rebranding and a Short, Turbulent Run</h2><p>The late 1970s saw a change of ownership. Horn & Hardart, a company known for its automat restaurants, acquired the Royal Inn for $17 million in 1979. They quickly rebranded it as the Royal Americana Hotel in late 1980, aiming for a more themed and potentially upscale appeal. Sadly, the Royal Americana proved unsuccessful, succumbing to significant financial losses. In 1982, Horn & Hardart made the difficult decision to close the hotel, a stark reminder of the cutthroat nature of the Las Vegas casino business. Cleverly, however, the casino remained open with limited offerings, preserving the valuable gaming license.</p><h2 id=the-paddlewheel-and-beyond>The <a href=/posts/paddlewheel-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/>Paddlewheel</a> and Beyond</h2><p>Just a little over a year later, the property experienced another resurrection. An investment group took over, renovated the space, and rebranded it once more as the Paddlewheel on November 21, 1983. The name evoked a nostalgic, riverboat gambling theme. However, the Paddlewheel&rsquo;s success was fleeting. Ultimately, the property fell into disuse, and today sits vacant.</p><h2 id=a-legacy-of-what-could-have-been>A Legacy of &ldquo;What Could Have Been&rdquo;</h2><p>The Royal Inn/Royal Americana/Paddlewheel is a poignant reminder that not every Las Vegas venture thrives. While it didn’t leave a lasting mark on the Strip’s skyline, its story offers a glimpse into a specific era – a time when smaller, more intimate hotels still had a place in the landscape. Now owned by developer Lorenzo Doumani, the land is slated for a non-gaming high-rise, &ldquo;Majestic Las Vegas.&rdquo; Though plans have been delayed, the site&rsquo;s history serves as a testament to the ever-changing nature of Las Vegas and the stories buried beneath the neon lights.</p><div class=shop-collection><h2>🎰 Shop the Royal Inn Hotel and Casino Las Vegas Collection</h2><div class=shop-links><a href=https://vintagevegasshirts.com/product/royal-inn-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas-triblend-tee/ class=shop-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Triblend Tee</a>
