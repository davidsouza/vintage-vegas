In 1950, it was still developing, a stretch of desert slowly transforming into a playground for adults. And at its heart stood the Desert Inn Hotel and Casino, a pivotal player in that evolution. Opened on April 24, 1950, it was the fifth resort to claim a spot on the Strip, nestled between what would become Desert Inn Road and <a href=/posts/sands-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/>Sands</a> Avenue. Imagine the scene: a 300-room hotel, a sprawling 2,400 square foot casino (a considerable size for Nevada at the time), and a vision for luxury in the Nevada desert.</p><h2 id=a-playground-for-the-elite-and-the-legends>A Playground for the Elite and the Legends</h2><p>The Desert Inn wasn’t just another casino; it aimed to attract a higher-end clientele. The design was sophisticated, reflecting a newfound elegance in Las Vegas. It was the first Strip resort to boast a grand fountain at its entrance, setting a tone of opulence. And then there was the entertainment. Perhaps the most significant moment for the Desert Inn came in 1951 when Frank Sinatra made his Las Vegas debut there. It wasn&rsquo;t just a performance; it was an introduction of &ldquo;The Voice&rdquo; to the Las Vegas scene, marking the beginning of a legendary relationship. Sinatra became a regular performer, cementing the Desert Inn&rsquo;s reputation as <em>the</em> place to be.</p><p>Beyond the casino and the stage, the Desert Inn offered a nine-hole golf course, a notable amenity. In 1953, it took on even greater significance by hosting the PGA Tour Tournament of Champions, a prestigious event that brought professional golf to the desert. The resort continuously expanded over the decades. The St. Andrews Tower (nine stories), the Augusta Tower (fourteen stories – eventually becoming the main tower), and the Wimbledon Tower (seven stories) added to the complex, followed by the Palms Tower in 1997 during a major $200 million renovation.</p><h2 id=a-fitting-end-and-a-new-beginning>A Fitting End and a New Beginning</h2><p>The Desert Inn’s story, sadly, had a bittersweet ending. Despite the final renovations and a renewed sense of purpose, in 2000, visionary developer Steve Wynn acquired the property for a remarkable $270 million. Recognizing the prime location and the underlying potential, Wynn planned to build something even grander. The Desert Inn officially closed its doors on August 28, 2000, marking the end of an era. Almost immediately, demolition began, with most of the towers falling to the dust. Only two towers remained, ultimately imploded in 2004 to clear space for Wynn Las Vegas and later, Encore Las Vegas.</p><p>However, the Desert Inn&rsquo;s legacy lives on. The iconic golf course, a cornerstone of the original resort, was incorporated into the Wynn resort, a subtle but poignant reminder of the pioneering spirit that once defined the Las Vegas Strip. Though the Desert Inn Hotel and Casino is physically gone, its contribution to Las Vegas history remains undeniable – it helped pave the way for the luxury and entertainment we associate with the Strip today.</p><div class=shop-collection><h2>🎰 Shop the Desert Inn Hotel and Casino Las Vegas Collection</h2><div class=shop-links><a href=https://vintagevegasshirts.com/product/desert-inn-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas-triblend-tee/ class=shop-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Triblend Tee</a>
