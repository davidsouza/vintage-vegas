    <h1 id="the-golden-goose-a-downtown-diamond-in-the-rough">The Golden Goose: A Downtown Diamond in the Rough</h1>
<p>Downtown Las Vegas, Fremont Street East – it’s a vibrant hub today, but its story is built on decades of evolution. And nestled within that history was the Golden Goose Hotel and Casino, a property that played a significant, if often overlooked, role in the landscape of vintage Las Vegas. Located at 20 Fremont Street, the Golden Goose took flight in 1975, marking a pivotal moment: it was the first casino entirely owned by Herb Pastor.</p>
<h2 id="herb-pastor-and-the-rise-of-a-downtown-entrepreneur">Herb Pastor and the Rise of a Downtown Entrepreneur</h2>
<p>Herb Pastor was a familiar face in Vegas gambling circles, having previously worked for other casinos. Owning the Golden Goose was his chance to be his own boss, to build something from the ground up. This wasn&rsquo;t just about bricks and mortar; it was about establishing his own legacy in a town fiercely competitive and constantly evolving. The Golden Goose, in its early days, was a relatively modest operation, offering a classic casino experience alongside a small hotel—the kind of place a working-class gambler felt comfortable. It represented a certain authenticity in a world that increasingly prioritized spectacle.</p>
<h2 id="glitter-gulch-connection-and-expansion">Glitter Gulch Connection and Expansion</h2>
<p>The Golden Goose’s significance grew considerably in 1982 when Pastor acquired the neighboring Glitter Gulch Casino. Combining the two properties under his ownership allowed for a more expansive gaming and entertainment experience for visitors. He expertly managed both casinos until 1991, establishing himself as a significant player in the Downtown scene. The combined Glitter Gulch/Golden Goose offered a unique vibe—a little rough around the edges, definitely real, and undeniably part of Fremont Street&rsquo;s character.  It wasn&rsquo;t striving to be the Bellagio; it was striving to be the best <em>it</em> could be.</p>
<h2 id="from-casino-to-gentlemens-club-and-beyond">From Casino to Gentlemen&rsquo;s Club and Beyond</h2>
<p>Following the closures of both properties in 1991, Pastor made a surprising pivot. He transformed the former casino sites into a gentlemen&rsquo;s club, the Girls of Glitter Gulch. This venture, which operated until 2016, further cemented the area’s reputation, albeit in a new and different way. Though the Girls of Glitter Gulch held its own place in the memory of many, the site&rsquo;s current iteration represents a completely new chapter.</p>
<h2 id="the-legacy-a-foundation-for-circa">The Legacy: A Foundation for Circa</h2>
<p>Today, the footprint of the Golden Goose and Glitter Gulch has been reimagined as Circa Resort &amp; Casino, a modern Downtown landmark. While the original buildings are gone, the land itself carries the weight of its past – the dreams and ambitions of Herb Pastor, the memories of countless gamblers, and the evolution of Downtown Las Vegas.  Circa’s very existence is built upon the foundation laid by those earlier ventures, a testament to the enduring power and constant reinvention that define Las Vegas history.</p>
