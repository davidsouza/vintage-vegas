While it only existed for a little over a decade, its development spanned decades, highlighting the ever-changing landscape of Las Vegas. The Heers family initially acquired the land way back in 1964, envisioning something for the budding tourist destination. However, plans started in the 1970s languished, only to be revived in 1988. Finally, on November 9, 1990, Vacation Village opened its doors, a decidedly modest resort positioned just south of the bustling main Strip. It aimed to offer a Southwest-inspired escape, a breath of fresh air amidst the glitz and glamor.</p><h2 id=quirkiness--value--a-locals-favorite>Quirkiness & Value – A Locals&rsquo; Favorite</h2><p>Vacation Village distinguished itself from its larger, more lavish neighbors through its commitment to value and unique theming. With just 315 rooms and a 15,000 square foot casino, it catered to a different clientele, appealing to locals and budget-conscious tourists. What truly set it apart was its “graveyard buffet.” This quirky dining experience, complete with tombstone décor, became a local talking point and drew visitors intrigued by the unusual theme. Coupons and value-based promotions further solidified its popularity within the local community. Post-1993 renovations added a 24-hour buffet and a sizable banquet room, anticipating larger events and increased traffic.</p><h2 id=more-than-just-a-casino>More Than Just a Casino</h2><p>The mid-1990s saw Vacation Village expanding its offerings to become a mini-destination in itself. Alongside the expected casino and dining options (including a Mexican restaurant), they introduced a Denny’s, the Great China Buffet, a bingo hall, a race book, a betting sports lounge, a wedding chapel, and even a liquor store. These diverse amenities were a gamble – offering convenience and something for everyone, but also adding complexity to operations.</p><h2 id=challenges--a-premature-end>Challenges & a Premature End</h2><p>Despite its best efforts, Vacation Village faced significant hurdles. An arson fire during construction in 1992 caused considerable setbacks and delays. Height restrictions imposed due to the planned new airport runway forced costly redesigns, further straining resources. By 2001, a crippling $19 million loan proved unsustainable, leading to Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The property was ultimately auctioned off and closed its doors on January 8, 2002, marking the end of an era and leaving 350 employees without jobs and 66 guests scrambling for alternative accommodations.</p><h2 id=from-casino-to-community-hub>From Casino to Community Hub</h2><p>Though short-lived, Vacation Village’s legacy endures. The land, acquired by Turnberry Associates and Centra Properties in 2004, underwent a dramatic transformation. By 2007, the space had been reimagined as Town Square Las Vegas, a vibrant open-air shopping center that’s become a beloved community gathering place. It’s a poignant reminder of how quickly things change in Las Vegas, and how even a quirky, value-driven resort can be replaced by something entirely new. The memory of the graveyard buffet and those budget-friendly coupons, however, remain a small but charming footnote in Las Vegas history.</p><div class=shop-collection><h2>🎰 Shop the Vacation Village Hotel and Casino Las Vegas Collection</h2><div class=shop-links><a href=https://vintagevegasshirts.com/product/vacation-village-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas-triblend-tee/ class=shop-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Triblend Tee</a>
