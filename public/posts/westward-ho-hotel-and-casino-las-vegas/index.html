In 1963, the landscape was evolving, with mid-sized hotels vying for attention. Enter the Westward Ho Hotel and Casino, affectionately nicknamed “The Ho” by its loyal clientele. Located strategically between the <a href=/posts/stardust-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/>Stardust</a> and where Slots-A-Fun would eventually stand, this 15-acre property felt like a slice of the Old West – a respectful nod to the spirit of the wagon trains that shaped the region’s history, as reflected in its name. Owned by Dean Petersen and his family, &ldquo;The Ho&rdquo; offered a more relaxed and approachable vibe than some of the more established, high-roller destinations.</p><h2 id=mid-century-charm-and-family-ownership>Mid-Century Charm and Family Ownership</h2><p>What set the Westward Ho apart was its unique layout. Unlike the towering structures we see today, it boasted low-rise, motel-style buildings nestled around a central casino. These buildings included pools, providing a welcome respite from the desert heat, and a distinct sense of community. By 1969, the property had ballooned to over 1,000 rooms, a testament to its growing popularity. The inclusion of a 24-hour Denny&rsquo;s – a staple for late-night gamblers and weary travelers – and a bustling slot arcade further solidified its appeal to a wide range of visitors. The Petersen family’s ownership fostered a sense of genuine hospitality that resonated with many, making it a favorite for locals and tourists alike.</p><h2 id=a-quiet-demise-and-a-pricey-land-deal>A Quiet Demise and a Pricey Land Deal</h2><p>The passing of Dean Petersen in 1997 marked the beginning of the end for the Westward Ho. Though Faye Johnson, his sister, kept the operation going for several years, the inevitable sale came in 2005. The property, still employing 650 people and housing a 35,000-square-foot casino, was valued at a significant $101.6 million. For a brief period, it seemed like things might stay relatively unchanged under new owner Francis Zarro. However, within a year, Harrah’s Entertainment initiated talks to trade it to Boyd Gaming in exchange for the <a href=/posts/barbary-coast-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/>Barbary Coast</a>.</p><h2 id=from-wagons-to-resorts-world>From Wagons to Resorts World</h2><p>The land that once held &ldquo;The Ho&rdquo; proved incredibly valuable. Boyd Gaming&rsquo;s initial plans involved expanding the Echelon Place project, but those ambitions were sidelined by the Great Recession. A single McDonald’s stood as a poignant reminder of the property’s legacy for a short time. Today, the sprawling Resorts World complex occupies the space, a testament to how dramatically Las Vegas has transformed. While the memories of “The Ho” might fade for some, it remains a significant chapter in the history of the Las Vegas Strip, a reminder of a time when the city was smaller, more intimate, and brimming with a different kind of charm.</p><div class=shop-collection><h2>🎰 Shop the Westward Ho Hotel and Casino Las Vegas Collection</h2><div class=shop-links><a href=https://vintagevegasshirts.com/product/westward-ho-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas-triblend-tee/ class=shop-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Triblend Tee</a>
