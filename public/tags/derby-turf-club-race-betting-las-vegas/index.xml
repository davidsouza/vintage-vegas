&lt;p&gt;The Las Vegas Strip&amp;rsquo;s evolution is fascinating, and often, the stories are not found &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; the Strip itself, but just a few blocks away. Take the Derby Turf Club, for example. Founded in December 1953, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a sprawling resort or a glitzy showplace, but a dedicated race and sports book located at 113 South 1st Street, nestled just off the bustling Fremont Street experience. Initially co-owned by Louis Nier and David Stearns, the Derby Turf Club quickly established itself as a hub for serious horse racing enthusiasts in a city rapidly embracing gambling. Its focus was laser-sharp: racing. While many Vegas casinos were expanding into other forms of wagering, the Derby Turf Club specialized, catering to a clientele eager for detailed information and competitive odds on races from around the country.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
