&lt;p&gt;The Las Vegas Strip wasn’t always about sprawling mega-resorts and high-roller casinos. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, it was a place defined by classic motels, independent diners, and the thrill of the open road. A perfect embodiment of this era was the Tip Top Drive-In, a beloved roadside eatery that sadly no longer exists. Opened in January 1959 at 1100 South Las Vegas Boulevard (the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Charleston Boulevard), Tip Top took over the location formerly occupied by Sill’s Drive-In, which had been servicing travelers since the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
