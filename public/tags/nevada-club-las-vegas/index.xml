&lt;p&gt;The mid-1950s Las Vegas Strip was a landscape of constant change, acquisition, and reinvention. In 1952, the story of what would become the legendary &lt;a href="https://vintage-vegas.com/posts/nevada-club-casino-las-vegas/"&gt;Nevada Club&lt;/a&gt; began with the purchase of the Santa Anita Turf Club. While the Turf Club had existed previously, the new ownership breathed fresh life into the property, officially opening as the Nevada Club.
