&lt;p&gt;Fremont Street, long before the glittering Viva Vision canopy, held a different kind of spectacle. It was a raw, vibrant, and sometimes rough-around-the-edges playground for Las Vegas. And nestled within that scene was a key player in the city&amp;rsquo;s adult entertainment landscape: Girls of Glitter Gulch. But understanding its story means digging back into the history of its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tale begins in 1975 with the Golden Goose. This wasn’t your average casino-hotel. It was a quirky, low-key establishment known for its relaxed atmosphere and, crucially, its topless entertainment. Next door, in 1980, Bob Stupak opened Glitter Gulch, aiming for a flashier, more opulent feel. Glitter Gulch, ironically named for an early Las Vegas mining area, quickly became a landmark with its cascading waterfall and glitzy décor. While offering casino games and restaurants, Glitter Gulch also incorporated elements of adult entertainment, recognizing the demand and profitability of the genre.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
