&lt;p&gt;The Royal Casino, formerly known by various names including Royal Las Vegas and &lt;a href="https://vintage-vegas.com/posts/royal-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/"&gt;Royal Hotel and Casino&lt;/a&gt;, occupies a unique and often overlooked spot in Las Vegas history. Located at 99 Convention Center Drive, just east of the iconic Las Vegas Strip, it existed as a steadfast, practical option for those attending the sprawling conventions hosted at the Las Vegas Convention Center. Opened in 1970 as part of the Royal Executive Inns chain, its initial focus was decidedly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the glitz and glamour of the Strip. Instead, it aimed to cater to the burgeoning business and convention crowd – a vital, and often understated, cornerstone of Las Vegas&amp;rsquo;s economy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
