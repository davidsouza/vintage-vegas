&lt;p&gt;The Opera House Hotel and Casino holds a unique place in Las Vegas Strip history. Located at 2111 Las Vegas Boulevard South (now the site of a Dotty&amp;rsquo;s), it wasn’t one of the mega-resorts we associate with modern Vegas. Instead, it represented a different era, a time when the Strip was still finding its identity, and affordable entertainment was the name of the game. Originally built as the Union Hotel in 1937, it went through several name changes before settling on the Opera House in the 1950s. Early incarnations were relatively modest, catering to a working-class clientele. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t glamorous, but it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; accessible.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
