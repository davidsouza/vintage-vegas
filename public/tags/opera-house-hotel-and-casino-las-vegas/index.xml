      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-theatrical-beginning-on-the-strip&#34;&gt;A Theatrical Beginning on the Strip&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before mega-resorts and dazzling shows, the Las Vegas Strip was a collection of smaller, character-filled establishments. Among them stood the Opera House Hotel and Casino, a landmark that, while relatively short-lived, left a mark on the city’s evolution. Originally built in 1956 as the Thunderbird Hotel, the property underwent a rebranding in 1963, taking on the name “Opera House.” This name change was meant to reflect its connection to a performance venue that once stood nearby, aiming to evoke a sense of classic Vegas entertainment. The original Thunderbird, with its distinctive architecture, was already a fixture on the Strip, and the Opera House attempted to build on that existing recognition while projecting a slightly more upscale image.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
