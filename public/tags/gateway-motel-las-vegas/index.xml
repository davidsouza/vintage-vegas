&lt;p&gt;The Gateway Motel, originally the Gateway Auto Court, stands as a silent witness to the evolution of Las Vegas. Opened in 1931 at 928 South Las Vegas Boulevard (now part of the bustling Strip), it represents a pivotal era in the city&amp;rsquo;s growth – a time when the road to Los Angeles was a vital artery, and Las Vegas was a small outpost catering to those traversing it. Founded by Gabriel Paher and his son Stanley M. Paher, the initial offering was remarkably modest: 27 Spanish-tiled cabins with carports, priced at a mere $1 per night. Think of it: a night&amp;rsquo;s lodging for the price of a modern cup of coffee! These weren’t luxury accommodations; they were practical shelter for weary travelers, a welcome sight along the dusty expanse of what would become the Las Vegas Strip. The lack of amenities speaks to a different era – an era of simple pleasures and the open road.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
