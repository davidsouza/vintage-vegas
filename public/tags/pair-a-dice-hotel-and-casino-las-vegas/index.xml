&lt;p&gt;The Pair-A-Dice Club casino, a name largely absent from modern Vegas lore, quietly entered the scene in 1956. Located at 2067 North Las Vegas Boulevard, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t situated on the famous Strip, but rather in the burgeoning North Las Vegas area, which was rapidly developing alongside the city&amp;rsquo;s explosive growth. The late 50s and early 60s were a period of frantic expansion for Las Vegas, and countless small casinos and entertainment venues popped up, all vying for a piece of the burgeoning tourism pie. While details about its early ownership and specific offerings are scarce – a common challenge with many of these forgotten establishments – the Pair-A-Dice represented that spirit of opportunity and risk that defined early Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
