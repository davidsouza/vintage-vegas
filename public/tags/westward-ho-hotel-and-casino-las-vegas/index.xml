&lt;p&gt;The Las Vegas Strip wasn&amp;rsquo;t always the glittering behemoth it is today. In 1963, the landscape was evolving, with mid-sized hotels vying for attention. Enter the Westward Ho Hotel and Casino, affectionately nicknamed “The Ho” by its loyal clientele. Located strategically between the &lt;a href="https://vintage-vegas.com/posts/stardust-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/"&gt;Stardust&lt;/a&gt; and where Slots-A-Fun would eventually stand, this 15-acre property felt like a slice of the Old West – a respectful nod to the spirit of the wagon trains that shaped the region’s history, as reflected in its name. Owned by Dean Petersen and his family, &amp;ldquo;The Ho&amp;rdquo; offered a more relaxed and approachable vibe than some of the more established, high-roller destinations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
