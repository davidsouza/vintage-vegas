&lt;p&gt;The mid-1960s were a pivotal time for Las Vegas. The city was rapidly evolving from a desert gambling outpost to a destination synonymous with glitz, glamour, and increasingly, elaborate entertainment.

Schwartz, the Dome wasn’t just a restaurant; it was an immersive theatrical experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
