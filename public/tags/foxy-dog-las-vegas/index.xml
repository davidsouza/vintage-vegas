&lt;p&gt;Fremont Street East was once teeming with unique, small-scale businesses that gave the area its signature character. Among them, &lt;em&gt;Foxy Dog&lt;/em&gt; at 326 Fremont Street, stood out as more than just a hot dog stand. Operating from the mid-1960s until the late 80s, it embodied a slice of classic Downtown Las Vegas, a place where simple pleasures and a bit of low-stakes gambling collided. Owned by the Fox family – Abe and Evelyn (also owners of Foxy&amp;rsquo;s Deli and Restaurant on the Strip) and their son Jerry, with Marjorie Fox as a corporate officer – Foxy Dog was a deliberate blend of quick, affordable food and casual entertainment. It wasn’t about the glitz and glamour of the Strip; it was about feeding the locals and providing a fun, accessible experience for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
