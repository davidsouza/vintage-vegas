&lt;p&gt;The Las Vegas Strip wasn&amp;rsquo;t always the glittering spectacle we know today. Back in the 1930s, it was U.S. Highway 91, a dusty road catering to travelers passing through the desert. One of the earliest establishments to recognize the potential was the Mountain View Auto Court, located at what is now 3320 Las Vegas Boulevard South. Imagine a collection of little cabins, a welcome respite for motorists. But that all changed in 1939 when it underwent a significant transformation and became the Sans Souci Hotel. The name, French for &amp;ldquo;without a care,&amp;rdquo; immediately projected an image of relaxation and luxury—a concept that would define the property for decades.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
