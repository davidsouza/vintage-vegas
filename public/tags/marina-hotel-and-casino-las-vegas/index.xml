      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-slice-of-mid-70s-vegas-the-rise-of-the-marina-hotel&#34;&gt;A Slice of Mid-70s Vegas: The Rise of the Marina Hotel&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Las Vegas Strip has seen countless transformations, but few stories are as poignant as that of the Marina Hotel and Casino. Built in 1975, the Marina wasn’t just another hotel; it represented a moment in Vegas history, a shift toward larger-scale resorts while still retaining a certain retro charm. Conceived by Tom Wiesner, and developed by his Wiesner Investment Company, the Marina sprung from the ashes of the older Golf Club Motel (which later briefly became the Mariner).
