&lt;p&gt;Before High Roller observation wheels and multiple sky-high lounges dotted the Las Vegas Strip, there was Top O’ The &lt;a href="https://vintage-vegas.com/posts/dunes-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/"&gt;Dunes&lt;/a&gt;. Originally christened &amp;ldquo;Top O’ The Strip&amp;rdquo; in 1965, this signature restaurant and lounge atop the Dunes Hotel &amp;amp; Casino offered a truly unique experience: fine dining with an unparalleled panoramic view. The Dunes, often referred to as the &amp;ldquo;Diamond of the Dunes,&amp;rdquo; was a landmark in itself, and its 21-story tower was one of the tallest buildings in Nevada at the time. Imagine that – a breathtaking, floor-to-ceiling vista of the glittering Strip, the bright lights of downtown, and the vast expanse of the desert. It was a view unlike anything else available at the time and quickly became a destination in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
