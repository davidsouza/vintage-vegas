&lt;p&gt;The story of Vacation Village Hotel and Casino, located at 6711 South Las Vegas Boulevard, isn’t a simple one. While it only existed for a little over a decade, its development spanned decades, highlighting the ever-changing landscape of Las Vegas. The Heers family initially acquired the land way back in 1964, envisioning something for the budding tourist destination. However, plans started in the 1970s languished, only to be revived in 1988. Finally, on November 9, 1990, Vacation Village opened its doors, a decidedly modest resort positioned just south of the bustling main Strip. It aimed to offer a Southwest-inspired escape, a breath of fresh air amidst the glitz and glamor.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
