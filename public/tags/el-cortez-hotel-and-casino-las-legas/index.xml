&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://vintage-vegas.com/posts/el-cortez-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/"&gt;El Cortez Hotel and Casino&lt;/a&gt;, affectionately known as “El Co,” stands as a testament to old-school Las Vegas charm. Opened on November 7, 1941, just months before the United States entered World War II, it was initially the brainchild of Guy Wells, a Los Angeles businessman. Back then, Las Vegas was a dusty, burgeoning town, still finding its footing as a gambling destination. The El Cortez, strategically located just a block from Fremont Street (then known as Main Street), quickly became a vital part of the nascent downtown core. The name &amp;ldquo;El Cortez&amp;rdquo; itself was a nod to Spanish exploration – a subtle signal of glamour and excitement for visitors.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
