&lt;p&gt;The 1970s and 80s saw Las Vegas evolving rapidly. Mega-resorts were beginning to dominate the Strip, but there was still a hunger for something different. Enter the Barbary Coast Hotel &amp;amp; Casino, which opened its doors on March 2, 1979. Developed by Michael Gaughan, son of the legendary Jackie Gaughan, the Barbary Coast was designed to be an elegant, intimate alternative to the increasingly colossal properties that were becoming the norm. Its location – the &amp;ldquo;Four Corners&amp;rdquo; of Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road – was prime real estate, previously occupied by the Desert Villa/Times Square Motel. Facing opposition from bigger players worried about traffic and zoning, Gaughan persevered, skillfully navigating the challenges, even designing around existing power lines.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
