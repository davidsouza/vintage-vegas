&lt;p&gt;The northeast corner of &lt;a href="https://vintage-vegas.com/posts/sahara-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/"&gt;Sahara&lt;/a&gt; and the Strip has seen countless changes over the decades, but few establishments left a mark as unique as the Holy Cow! Casino Cafe Brewery. Its story isn&amp;rsquo;t just about a casino; it&amp;rsquo;s about a slice of Vegas history, encompassing inclusive origins, groundbreaking brewing, and a whole lot of local charm. The site’s earliest incarnation was Foxy’s Deli, which opened in 1955. Remarkably, Foxy’s held the distinction of being the Strip’s first integrated restaurant, a progressive move at a time when racial segregation was still a stark reality in many parts of the country. Legendary performers like Liberace, Wayne Newton, and Shecky Greene were frequent patrons, solidifying its place in the early Vegas scene.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
