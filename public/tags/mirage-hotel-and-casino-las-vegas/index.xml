&lt;p&gt;The Las Vegas Strip had seen its share of glitz and glamour, but in 1989, it was about to be shaken to its core. Enter the Mirage Hotel &amp;amp; Casino, officially opening its doors on November 22nd, after a grueling two-year construction period and a staggering $630 million investment – the most expensive resort the world had seen at the time. Steve Wynn, a visionary with a reputation for pushing boundaries, was the driving force behind this ambitious project. Financed, somewhat controversially, through junk bonds, the Mirage was more than just a casino; it was a statement. For over fifteen years, no new mega-resorts had been built on the Strip, and Wynn intended to change that, ushering in a new era of Las Vegas luxury and entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
