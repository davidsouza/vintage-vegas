&lt;p&gt;The 1960s were a pivotal time for Las Vegas, a burgeoning playground for the wealthy and a beacon of modern design. Nestled on Fremont Street, then the heart of Vegas’s entertainment district, the Orbit Inn, opening in 1963 at 707 East Fremont, was a perfect embodiment of this era. Built by the Franklin Brothers, this three-story, 73-room motel was initially part of the Best Western chain, but it quickly distinguished itself. What made the Orbit Inn so special wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a comfortable room – it was the &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt;. Think sleek, Space-Age architecture, a sparkling rooftop swimming pool (a rarity for roadside motels), and, crucially, “refrigerated” air conditioning – a serious luxury back then.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
