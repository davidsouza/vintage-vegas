&lt;p&gt;The northeast corner of &lt;a href="https://vintage-vegas.com/posts/sahara-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas/"&gt;Sahara&lt;/a&gt; Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard has seen a lot of changes over the years, but few establishments were as uniquely memorable as the Holy Cow! Casino Cafe Brewery. Its history isn’t a simple one; it’s a layered story of adaptation and innovation stretching back to 1955. Originally, the spot was “Foxy’s Deli,” a groundbreaking establishment lauded as the Strip’s first integrated restaurant. That meant it welcomed both locals and tourists, a somewhat revolutionary concept back then. The celebrity clientele – including legends like Liberace, Wayne Newton, and Shecky Greene – only added to its allure and solidified its place in early Las Vegas lore.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
