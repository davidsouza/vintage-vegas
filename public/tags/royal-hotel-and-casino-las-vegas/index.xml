&lt;p&gt;The Las Vegas Strip, for all its glitz and grandeur, isn&amp;rsquo;t solely built on high-roller gamblers. A significant portion of Vegas&amp;rsquo;s economic engine relies on the thriving convention industry. The Royal Hotel and Casino, located at 99 Convention Center Drive, just east of the Strip and adjacent to the Las Vegas Convention Center, understood this from the very beginning. Opening in 1970 as the Royal Las Vegas, it was initially part of the Royal Executive Inns chain, a group focused on providing reliable and affordable lodging for business travelers. Unlike its flashier neighbors, the Royal wasn&amp;rsquo;t vying for the attention of the casual tourist; it aimed to be the dependable home base for convention attendees and business professionals.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
